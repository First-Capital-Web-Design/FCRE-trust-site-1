we encourage you to authorize a proxy to vote your Common Shares via the Internet, a convenient means of authorizing a proxy that
also provides cost savings to us. In addition, when you authorize a proxy to vote your Common Shares via the Internet or by telephone
prior to the Annual Meeting date, your proxy authorization is recorded immediately and there is no risk that postal delays will
cause your vote by proxy to arrive late and, therefore, not be counted. For further instructions on authorizing a proxy to vote
your Common Shares, see your proxy card enclosed with this Proxy Statement. You may also vote your Common Shares at the Annual
Meeting. If you attend the Annual Meeting, you may submit your vote in person, and any previous votes that you submitted by mail
or authorized by Internet or telephone will be superseded by the vote that you cast at the Annual Meeting.</p>

all the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present. Any Common Shares not voted (whether
by abstention, broker non-vote, or otherwise) have no impact on the vote. A broker non-vote occurs when a broker
who holds Common Shares for the beneficial owner does not vote on a proposal because the broker does not have discretionary voting
authority for that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of Common Shares.</p>

proxies for the meeting. Solicitations may be made on behalf of the Board of Directors by mail, personal interview, telephone or
other electronic means by our officers and other employees of the Advisor, as defined below, who will receive no additional compensation.
We will request banks, brokers, custodians, nominees, fiduciaries and other record holders to forward copies of this proxy statement
to people on whose behalf they hold Common Shares and to request authority for the exercise of proxies by the record holders on
behalf of those people. In compliance with the regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC),
we will reimburse such persons for reasonable expenses incurred by them in forwarding proxy materials to the beneficial owners
of our Common Shares.</p>

LP (the Advisor), will solicit proxies. We will not pay the Advisor for such services; however, we will provide reimbursement
of its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses. As the date of the 2015 annual meeting of stockholders approaches, certain stockholders
may receive a telephone call from a representative of the Advisor if their votes have not yet been received. Proxies that are obtained
telephonically will be recorded in accordance with the procedures described below. The Board of Directors believes that these procedures
are reasonably designed to ensure that both the identity of the stockholder casting the vote and the voting instructions of the
stockholder are accurately determined.</p>

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.25in">In all cases where a telephonic proxy is solicited,
the Advisor representative is required to ask for each stockholders full name and address, or the ZIP code or employer identification
number, and to confirm that the stockholder has received the proxy materials in the mail. If the stockholder is a corporation or
other entity, the Advisor representative is required to ask for the persons title and confirmation that the person is authorized
to direct the voting of the shares. If the information solicited agrees with the information provided to the Advisor, then the
Advisor representative has the responsibility to explain the process, read the proposal listed on the proxy card and ask for the
stockholders instructions on the proposal. Although the Advisor representative is permitted to answer questions about the
process, he or she is not permitted to recommend to the stockholder how to vote, other than read any recommendations set forth
in this proxy statement. The Advisor will record the stockholders instructions on the card. Within 72 hours, the stockholder
will be sent a letter or mailgram to confirm his or her vote and asking the stockholder to call the Advisor immediately if his
or her instructions are not correctly reflected in the confirmation.</p>

your Common Shares are voted. If you hold your Common Shares in registered form and wish to combine your stockholder accounts in
the future, you should call us at (212) 388-6800. Combining accounts reduces excess printing and mailing costs, resulting in cost
savings to us that benefit you as a stockholder.</p>

officer is ultimately responsible for ensuring the successful operation of the Company and its business, which is also the main
focus of the Boards deliberations, the chief executive officer is the most qualified director to act as chairman, and that
designating a lead independent director is not necessary at this time. The Board of Directors may modify this structure to best
address the Companys circumstances for the benefit of its stockholders when appropriate.</p>

required of directors in the context of our business. This review includes, in the context of the perceived needs of the Board
at that time, issues of knowledge, experience, judgment and skills relating to the understanding of the real estate industry, accounting
or financial expertise. This review also includes the candidates ability to attend regular Board meetings and to devote
a sufficient amount of time and effort in preparation for such meetings. The Board also gives consideration to the Board having
a diverse and appropriate mix of backgrounds and skills and each nominees ability to exercise independence of thought, objective
perspective and mature judgment and understand our business operations and objectives.</p>

has determined to reduce the size of the Board to three directors. A majority of these directors must be
independent except for a period of up to 60 days after the death, resignation or removal of an independent director.
An independent director is defined under the Charter as one who is not associated and has not been associated within
the last two years, directly or indirectly, with our Sponsor or Advisor. A director is deemed to be associated with our Sponsor
or Advisor if he or she: (a) owns an interest in our Sponsor, Advisor or any of their affiliates, other than the Company; (b) is
employed by our Sponsor, Advisor or any of their affiliates; (c) is an officer or director of the Sponsor, Advisor or any of their
affiliates other than as a director of the Company; (d) performs services, other than as a director, for us; (e) is a director
or trustee for more than three REITs organized by our Sponsor or advised by our Advisor; or (f) has any material business or professional
relationship with our Sponsor, Advisor or any of their affiliates. A business or professional relationship is considered material
per se if the aggregate gross income derived by the director from our Sponsor and our Advisor and affiliates exceeds 5% of the
directors (i) annual gross revenue, during either of the last two years, or (ii) net worth, on a fair market value basis.
An indirect relationship with our Sponsor or Advisor includes circumstances in which a directors spouse, parents, children,
siblings, mothers- or fathers-in-law, sons- or daughters-in-law, or brothers- or sisters-in-law, is or has been associated with
our Sponsor, Advisor, any of their affiliates or us. Our Charter is available on the Companys website at http://www.unitedrealtytrust.com/URTCorporateGovernance.html

that Dr. Daniel Z. Aronzon and Mr. David B. Newman have no material relationship with the Company (either directly or as a
partner, stockholder or officer of an organization that has a relationship with the Company) other than as a director of the

align the long-term financial interest of our independent directors, officers and employees (if we ever have employees), employers
of the Advisor and other affiliates, certain of our consultants and certain consultants to the Advisor and other affiliates who,
directly or indirectly, provide consulting services to us, with those of our stockholders. The compensation committee intends to
design long-term incentive awards to ensure that eligible officers, employees, consultants and independent directors have a continuing
stake in our long-term success, that the total compensation realized by our executive officers reflects our multi-year performance
as measured by the efficient use of capital and changes in stockholder value, and that a large portion of our executive officers
total compensation is earned over a multi-year period and is forfeitable if the employment of the executive officer is terminated.</p>

of employment on the second day after we release our financial results for that quarter. The exercise price for stock options will
be determined by the compensation committee at the time of the grant and will not be less than 100% (or, in the case of an incentive
stock option granted to a ten percent stockholder, 110%) of the fair market value of the Common Shares at the time of the grant.

Board of Directors, our Chief Executive Officer and our Secretary. Our Sponsor is controlled and indirectly owned by Mr. Frydman.
We are externally advised by the Advisor, which is controlled by Mr. Frydman, who also holds a majority of the economic interests
in it. We executed an advisory agreement with the Advisor, a dealer manager agreement with Cabot Lodge Securities, LLC, an affiliate
of the Sponsor (the Dealer Manager), and a property management agreement with URA Property Management LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (the Property Manager), also an affiliate of the Sponsor. These agreements entitle the
Advisor, the Dealer Manager, and the Property Manager to specified fees upon the provision of certain services with regard to the
offering and the investment of funds in real estate properties and real estate-related investments, among other services, as well
as reimbursement of organization and offering expenses incurred by the Advisor and the Dealer Manager on behalf of the Company,
as discussed in the chart below, and certain costs incurred by the Advisor in providing services to us. The Company may engage
United Realty Partners LLC (URP), an entity controlled and indirectly owned by the Companys president and
chief executive officer, to provide brokerage services, services in connection with the origination or refinancing of debt, or
advice in connection with joint venture opportunities and equity financing opportunities for the Companys properties.</p>

associated with the highest possible selling commissions and dealer manager fee. No effect is given to any Common Shares sold through

Our use of net cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, as a metric instead of GAAP net income likely will result in the payment of a higher amount to the Advisor than if the Advisor were to receive, annually, an amount equal to 15% of GAAP net income after payment of such 7% annual return. We cannot assure you that we will provide such 7% annual return, which we have disclosed solely as a measure for the Advisors incentive compensation. Because such 7% annual return may consist in part of distributions from sources other than operating cash flow, the source of such 7% annual return may not be entirely from net income; to the extent that the source of such 7% annual return is not from net income, then the value of your Common Shares may be impacted negatively. Our advisor may have an incentive to increase the amount of distributions from sources other than operating cash flow in order to maximize its subordinated share of annual cash flows. Our advisor may receive a subordinated share of annual cash flows even if distributions to holders of Common Shares have exceeded our cash flows from operations.</td>

letter required by applicable requirements of the PCAOB regarding the independent accountants communication with the audit
committee concerning independence and represented that it is independent from us. When considering the independence of Ernst &amp;
Young LLP, the audit committee considered if services they provided to us, beyond those rendered in connection with their audit
of our consolidated financial statement and their reviews of our interim condensed consolidated financial statements included in
our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, were compatible with maintaining their independence. The audit committee also reviewed and
approved the independent registered public accounting firms fees, both for performing audit and non-audit services, and
considered whether the provision of non-audit services by the independent registered public accounting firm was compatible with
maintaining the independent registered public accounting firms independence and concluded that it was compatible.</p>
