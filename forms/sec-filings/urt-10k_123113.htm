as a Maryland corporation intending to elect and qualify as a real estate investment trust (&ldquo;REIT&rdquo;) for federal
income tax purposes. We intend to elect and qualify as a REIT beginning with the taxable year that ended December 31, 2013.
As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to corporate-level income taxes. To maintain REIT status, we will be required,
among other requirements, to distribute annually at least 90% of our &ldquo;REIT taxable income,&rdquo; as defined by
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;), to our stockholders. If we failed to qualify as a
REIT in any taxable year, we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates.</P>

return for the tax year ending December 31, 2011 on Internal Revenue Service (&ldquo;IRS&rdquo;), Form 1120-REIT, which&nbsp;was
treated as having made our REIT election commencing with that tax year.&nbsp;In 2012, we did not qualify as a REIT.&nbsp;We have
filed for relief from the IRS so that we will not be treated as having made our REIT election prior to our tax year ending December
31, 2013.&nbsp; It is solely within the discretion of the IRS to grant the relief sought by us.&nbsp; If we are unable to obtain
the relief we seek from the IRS, we would be unable to make our REIT election prior to the fifth taxable year after the year in
which we failed to qualify as a REIT.</P>

of 20,000,000 Common Shares available pursuant to our distribution reinvestment program (&ldquo;DRIP&rdquo;)), subject
to certain volume and other discounts, pursuant to our Registration Statement. We were initially capitalized on November
17, 2011 with $200,000 from the sale of 18,182 Common Shares to United Realty Advisor Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited
liability company (our &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;). On November 25, 2011, our Sponsor acquired 500,000 shares of preferred
stock, subsequently exchanged for 500,000 shares of preferred stock classified as Sponsor Preferred Shares (the
&ldquo;Sponsor Preferred Shares&rdquo;), for an aggregate purchase price of $50,000. As of December 31, 2013, we had 673,727
Common Shares outstanding with an aggregate value of approximately $6.8 million. We are dependent upon the net proceeds from
our IPO to conduct our operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">We are The Dual Strategy REIT. We intend to invest
primarily in interests in real estate located in the United States, with a primary focus on the eastern United States and in markets
that we believe are likely to benefit from favorable demographic changes, or that we believe are poised for strong economic growth.
We may invest in interests in a wide variety of commercial property types, including office, industrial, retail and hospitality
properties, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, age-restricted residences and in other real estate-related assets.
We expect to build a high-quality portfolio intended to generate current income and to provide capital preservation, capital appreciation
and portfolio diversification. Our properties may be existing income-producing properties, newly constructed properties or properties
under development or under construction. We also may seek to acquire assets from sellers who are distressed or who face time-sensitive
selling deadlines, or from owners or institutions who have acquired assets through foreclosure. We may acquire assets directly
or through joint ventures, by making an equity investment in a project, or by making a mezzanine or bridge loan with a right to
acquire equity in the project. We also may buy debt secured by an asset with a view toward acquiring the asset through foreclosure.
We also may originate or invest in mortgages, bridge or mezzanine loans and tenant-in-common interests, or entities that make investments
similar to the foregoing. Further, we may invest in real estate-related securities, including securities issued by other real estate
companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">We expect to invest approximately 80% of our funds
in direct real estate investments and other equity interests, and approximately 20% of our funds in debt interests, which may include
bridge or mezzanine loans. We expect this breakdown to remain approximately the same even if we only raise the minimum offering
amount or an amount substantially less than our maximum offering amount.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">In order to meet our investment objectives
we deploy a dual strategy in building our portfolio. The first strategy focuses on acquiring existing stabilized
cash-flowing assets to support stable, consistent dividend distributions to our stockholders. The second strategy focuses
on acquiring opportunistic assets which we can reposition, redevelop or remarket to create value enhancement and capital
appreciation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">By pursuing both strategies simultaneously we
believe we can most effectively achieve our desired investment objectives. In executing on our investment objectives we will consider
the state of the current real estate and capital markets in the United States in conjunction with our views of likely future developments
which will impact both the real estate and capital markets in the United States.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Prior to acquiring an asset, our Advisor performs
an analysis of the asset to determine whether it meets our investment criteria, including the probability of sale at an optimum
price within our targeted holding period. Our Advisor uses the information derived from the analysis in determining whether the
asset is an appropriate investment for us. We intend to employ our dual investment strategies, with a view towards generating current
cash flow as well as realizing growth in the value of our assets and hedging against inflation. We intend that our overall strategy
will involve one or more of the following attributes:</P>

primarily in existing, stabilized income-producing properties which have shorter-term leases or leases which provide for periodic
increases through fixed rent increases or adjustment based on increases in the consumer price index, as a way to guard against
potential inflation. Therefore, we will generally not seek to acquire properties which are fully leased on a long-term basis with
fixed rents which are not adjustable if inflation occurs, except where leases are of shorter duration, or where our objectives
may be achieved from other characteristics of such properties.</P>

primarily in assets that we believe may be repositioned or redeveloped so that they will reach an optimum value within three to
six years from the termination of our IPO. We may acquire properties with lower tenant quality or low occupancy rates and reposition
them by seeking to improve the property, tenant quality and occupancy rates and thereby increase lease revenues and overall property
value. Further, we may invest in properties that we believe are an attractive value because all or a portion of the tenant leases
expire within a short period after the date of acquisition, and we intend to renew leases or replace existing tenants at the properties
for improved returns. We may acquire properties in markets that are depressed or overbuilt with the anticipation that, within our
targeted holding period, the markets will recover and favorably impact the value of these properties. We may also acquire properties
from sellers who are distressed or face time-sensitive deadlines with the expectation that we can achieve better success with the
properties. Many of the markets where we will acquire properties may have high growth potential in real estate lease rates and
sale prices.</P>

Our Advisor uses modeling tools that our Advisor believes will help us identify favorable property acquisitions and enable it to
forecast growth. Using these tools together with our overall strategies, including individual market monitoring and ongoing analysis
of macro- and micro-regional economic cycles, we expect to be better able to identify favorable acquisition targets, increase current
returns and current distributions to investors, maintain higher relative portfolio property values, conduct appropriate development
or redevelopment activities and execute timely dispositions at appropriate sales prices to enhance capital gains distributable
to our investors.</P>

by our independent directors. Regardless, we will generally obtain an independent appraisal for each property in which we invest.
However, we will rely on our own independent analysis and not on appraisals in determining whether to invest in a particular property.
Appraisals are estimates of value and should not be relied upon as measures of true worth or realizable value.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Once we have fully invested the proceeds of our
IPO, assuming we sell the maximum amount, our portfolio-wide loan-to-value ratio (calculated after the close of our IPO) will be
approximately 65%. For purposes of calculating our 65% target leverage, we will determine the loan-to-value ratio on our portfolio
based on the greater of the aggregate cost and the fair market value of our investments and other assets. There is no limitation
on the amount we may borrow for the purchase of any single asset. Our charter allows us to incur leverage up to 300% of our total
&ldquo;net assets&rdquo; (as defined in Section I.B of the NASAA REIT Guidelines) as of the date of any borrowing, which is generally
expected to be approximately 75% of the cost of our investments. We may only exceed this 300% limit if a majority of our independent
directors approves each borrowing in excess of this limit and we disclose such borrowing to our stockholders in our next quarterly
report along with a justification for the excess borrowing. For example purposes only, substantial justification could be found
by the independent directors: (a) if the value of our portfolio declined and new borrowings were necessary to repay existing obligations;
(b) to pay sufficient distributions to maintain our REIT status; or (c) to buy a property where an exceptional acquisition opportunity
presents itself and the terms of the debt and nature of the property are such that the debt does not materially increase the risk
that we would become unable to meet our financial obligations as they became due. During the early stages of our IPO, and to the
extent financing in excess of our charter limit is available at attractive terms, we believe that the majority of our independent
directors may be more likely to approve debt in excess of this limit. In all events, we expect that our secured and unsecured borrowings
will be reasonable in relation to the net value of our assets and will be reviewed by our board of directors at least quarterly.</P>

stage, our board will authorize and we will declare distributions in anticipation of funds that we expect to receive during a later
period and we will pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. In these instances, we expect to look

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">There currently is no public market for our Common
Shares, and there may never be one. If you are able to find a buyer for your Common Shares, you may not sell your Common Shares
unless the buyer meets applicable suitability and minimum purchase standards and the sale does not violate state securities laws.
Our charter also prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding shares of stock or more
than 9.8% (in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding Common Shares, unless exempted by
our board of directors (prospectively or retroactively), which may inhibit large investors from desiring to purchase your Common

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Repurchase of Common Shares through our share repurchase program
may be the only way to dispose of your Common Shares, but there are a number of limitations placed on such repurchases. Prior to
the NAV pricing start date, stockholders may have their Common Shares repurchased (a) in the case of hardship, at the total offering
price paid, or (b) in the sole discretion of our Advisor, at a price equal to 92% of the total offering price paid, but in neither
event at a price greater than the offering price per Common Share under our DRIP. Following the NAV pricing start date, the Common
Shares may be repurchased at a price equal to 95% of the NAV per Common Share as of the repurchase date (although while the primary
offering is ongoing, in no event will the repurchase price following the NAV pricing start date exceed the then-current offering
price under the primary offering), not the original total offering price. As used in this Annual Report, (a) &ldquo;NAV&rdquo;
means net asset value, (b) &ldquo;NAV pricing start date&rdquo; means the earliest to occur of: (i) our investing in assets with
an aggregate cost, including our pro rata share (direct or indirect) of debt attributable to such assets, in excess of $1 billion;
(ii) our raising net offering proceeds of in excess of $650 million in our primary offering; and (iii) January 15, 2015 and (c)
&ldquo;hardship,&rdquo; with respect to a stockholder, means: (i) the death of the stockholder; (ii) the bankruptcy of the stockholder;
(iii) a mandatory distribution under the stockholder&rsquo;s IRA; or (iv) another involuntary exigent circumstance, as approved
by our board.</P>

that would limit your ability to sell your Common Shares to us, including a requirement that you shall have held your Common Shares
for a period of one year before they will be eligible for repurchase. Therefore, you may be required to sell your Common Shares
at a substantial discount to the price you originally paid. Furthermore, our board of directors reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, at any time and from time to time, to amend the terms of, suspend or terminate our share repurchase program. Additionally,
our board of directors reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to reject an individual stockholder&rsquo;s request for repurchase
for any reason at any time. Therefore, it will be difficult for you to sell your Common Shares promptly or at all.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">It also is likely that your Common Shares would
not be accepted as the primary collateral for a loan. You should purchase the Common Shares only as a long-term investment because
of the illiquid nature of the Common Shares. See &ldquo;Investor Suitability Standards,&rdquo; &ldquo;Description of Shares &mdash;

our share repurchase program without stockholder approval. Our board of directors also is free to suspend or terminate the program
or to reject any request for repurchase. In addition, our share repurchase program includes numerous restrictions that would limit
your ability to sell your Common Shares. Our ability to fulfill repurchase requests is subject to a number of limitations. Most
importantly, most of our assets consist of real estate properties which cannot generally be readily liquidated without impacting
our ability to realize full value upon their disposition. In addition, following the NAV pricing start date, we will limit Common
Shares repurchased during a calendar quarter to 5% of our NAV as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter, or approximately
20% of our NAV in any 12-month period. Please note that the NAV pricing start date could occur as late as January 15, 2015. Furthermore,
our board of directors may limit, modify or suspend our share repurchase program, and our Advisor may limit the amount of repurchases
on a quarterly basis. Repurchase of Common Shares through our share repurchase program may be the only way to dispose of your Common

the payment of fees and expenses, in the acquisition of real estate and real estate-related assets. We have established policies
relating to the creditworthiness of tenants, but our board of directors will have wide discretion in implementing these policies,
and you will not have the opportunity to evaluate potential tenants. In light of our desire to purchase properties that we believe
present an opportunity for enhanced future value, the creditworthiness of existing tenants may not be a significant factor in determining
whether to acquire the property. We anticipate that we will invest in properties that we believe may be repositioned for greater
value due, in whole or in part, to the presence of tenants that do not have strong credit. In such cases, our strategy will include
repositioning the property to attract new, more creditworthy or different types of tenants. For a more detailed discussion of our

development or redevelopment projects or in properties that have significant capital requirements, our ability to make distributions
may be negatively impacted, especially during our early periods of operation. Therefore, until such time as we have sufficient
cash flow from operations to fully fund the payment of distributions therefrom, some of or all our distributions will be paid from

equal to 15% of any net cash flows in respect of each calendar year remaining after payment to holders of Common Shares of distributions
(including from sources other than operating cash flow) for such calendar year, such that the holders of Common Shares have received
a 7%&nbsp;pre-tax, non-compounded annual return on the capital contributed by holders of Common Shares. However, if such 7%&nbsp;annual
return is not achieved in subsequent years, and even if our company suffers a loss, our Advisor will not be obligated to return
to our company any portion of the subordinated share of annual cash flows it has received. &ldquo;Net cash flows&rdquo; means,
for any period, the excess of: (i) the sum of (A) our revenues for such period, as determined under GAAP, from ownership and/or
operation of properties, loans and other investments and (B) the net cash proceeds we realize during such period from any sales
of assets; over (ii) the sum of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by us, as determined under GAAP, that are in any way related
to our operation or to corporate business, including advisory fees, the expenses of raising capital such as organization and offering
expenses, legal, audit, accounting, underwriting, brokerage, listing, registration and other fees, printing and other such expenses
and taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, distribution, transfer, registration and listing of our Common Shares, interest
payments, taxes, non-cash expenditures such as depreciation, amortization and bad debt reserves, incentive fees paid in compliance
with the NASAA REIT Guidelines, acquisition fees and acquisition expenses, real estate commissions on the sale of property and
other fees and expenses connected with the acquisition, disposition, management and ownership of real estate interests, mortgage
loans or other property (including the costs of foreclosure, insurance premiums, legal services, maintenance, repair and improvement
of property). Our use of &ldquo;net cash flow&rdquo;, a non-GAAP measure, as a metric instead of GAAP net income likely will result
in the payment of a higher amount to our Advisor than if our Advisor were to receive, annually, an amount equal to 15% of GAAP
net income after payment of such 7% annual return. We cannot assure you that we will provide such 7% annual return, which we have
disclosed solely as a measure for our Advisor&rsquo;s incentive compensation. Because such 7% annual return may consist in part
of distributions from sources other than operating cash flow, the source of such 7% annual return may not be entirely from net
income; to the extent that the source of such 7% annual return is not from net income, then the value of your Common Shares may
be impacted negatively. Our Advisor may have an incentive to increase the amount of distributions from sources other than operating
cash flow in order to maximize its subordinated share of annual cash flows. Our Advisor may receive a subordinated share of annual
cash flows even if distributions to holders of Common Shares have exceeded our cash flows from operations. In addition, our Sponsor
owns the Sponsor Preferred Shares, which upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, would receive a preference in the amount
of 15% of any excess of the net sales proceeds from the sale of all the assets in connection with such liquidation, dissolution
or winding up over the amount of Invested Capital, as defined in the section of our prospectus titled &ldquo;Description of Shares
&mdash; Sponsor Preferred Shares,&rdquo; plus a cumulative non-compounded pre-tax annual return to holders of Common Shares of
7% on Invested Capital. Any cash flows to holders of Common Shares in excess of the 7%&nbsp;annual return contemplated by the subordinated
share of annual cash flows would constitute a return of capital for purposes of the preference of the Sponsor Preferred Shares,
so the amount of Invested Capital for purposes of the preference of the Sponsor Preferred Shares would be lower, allowing our Sponsor
to receive a larger amount of cash flow upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up.</P>

your interest in us could be diluted, and we could incur other significant costs associated with being self-managed.</I></B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Our strategy may involve becoming &ldquo;self-managed&rdquo;
by internalizing our management functions, particularly if we seek to list our Common Shares on an exchange as a way of providing
our stockholders with a liquidity event. The method by which we could internalize these functions could take many forms. We may
hire our own group of executives and other employees or we may elect to negotiate to acquire our Advisor&rsquo;s and Property Manager&rsquo;s
assets and personnel. At this time, we cannot be sure of the form or amount of consideration or other terms relating to any such
acquisition. Such consideration could take many forms, including cash payments, promissory notes and shares of our stock. An internalization
transaction could result in significant payments to affiliates of our Advisor irrespective of whether you enjoyed the returns on
which we have conditioned our subordinated share of annual cash flows. The payment of such consideration could result in dilution
of your interests as a stockholder and could reduce the net income per Common Share and modified funds from operations per Common
Share attributable to your investment. We will not be required to seek a stockholder vote to become self-managed.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">In addition, our direct expenses would include
general and administrative costs, including legal, accounting and other expenses related to corporate governance and SEC reporting
and compliance. If stockholders or other interested parties file a lawsuit related to, or challenging, an internalization transaction,
we could incur high litigation costs that would adversely affect the value of your Common Shares. We also would incur the compensation
and benefits costs of our officers and other employees and consultants that are now paid by our Advisor or its affiliates. In addition,
we may issue equity awards under our stock incentive plan, which awards would decrease net income and modified funds from operations
and may further dilute your investment. We cannot reasonably estimate the amount of fees to our Advisor and its affiliates we would
save and the costs we would incur if we became self-managed. If the expenses we assume as a result of an internalization are higher
than the expenses we avoid paying to our Advisor and its affiliates, our net income per Common Share and funds from operations
per Common Share would be lower as a result of the internalization than it otherwise would have been, potentially decreasing the
amount of funds available to distribute to our stockholders and the value of our Common Shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">As currently organized, we do not directly employ
any employees. If we elect to internalize our operations, we would employ personnel and would be subject to potential liabilities
commonly faced by employers, such as workers disability and compensation claims, potential labor disputes and other employee-related
liabilities and grievances. Nothing in our charter prohibits us from entering into the transaction described above.</P>

our management functions will prove to be beneficial to us and our stockholders. We could have difficulty integrating our management
functions as a stand-alone entity. Certain personnel of our Advisor and its affiliates perform property management, asset management
and general and administrative functions, including accounting and financial reporting, for multiple entities. We could fail to
properly identify the appropriate mix of personnel and capital needs to operate as a stand-alone entity. An inability to manage
an internalization transaction effectively could thus result in our incurring excess costs or suffering deficiencies in our disclosure
controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting. Such deficiencies could cause us to incur additional
costs, and our management&rsquo;s attention could be diverted from most effectively managing our portfolio of investments.</P>

employees in the future. If this occurs, these programs could hire certain of the persons currently employed by our Advisor or

for losses unless they are grossly negligent or engage in willful misconduct. As a result, you and we may have more limited rights
against our independent directors than might otherwise exist under common law, which could reduce your and our recovery from these

to be used in calculating our daily NAV, all of which the board of directors will approve. The valuation may not be precise because
the valuation methodologies used to value a real estate portfolio involve subjective judgments, assumptions and opinions about

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Following the NAV pricing start date and for purposes
of our DRIP and share repurchase program, our independent valuer will estimate at least annually the market value of our principal
assets and liabilities, and also provide the metrics to be used in the subsequent calculation of NAV, and we will rely on those
estimates to determine the daily NAV per Common Share. As a result, the published NAV per Common Share may not fully reflect changes
in value that may have occurred since the prior valuation. Furthermore, it may be difficult to reflect changing market conditions
or material events that may impact the value of our portfolio between valuations, or to obtain timely complete information regarding
any such events. Therefore, the NAV per Common Share published after the announcement of an extraordinary event may differ significantly
from our actual NAV until such time as sufficient information is available and analyzed, the financial impact is fully evaluated,
and the appropriate adjustment to be made to NAV, on a going forward basis, is determined by our Advisor and our independent valuer.

of interest relating to the incentive fee structure under our advisory agreement, which could result in actions that are not necessarily

month and (b) one-twelfth (1/12) of 0.75% of the contract purchase price of each property (including our pro rata share (direct

Because in the case of (a) above, this fee will be based on NAV, our Advisor will benefit from our Common Shares having higher
NAV and therefore our Advisor has an incentive to cause the NAV to be higher. In the case of (b) above, fees payable to our Advisor
are based on the purchase price of the investments acquired and may create an incentive for our Advisor to accept a higher purchase
price or purchase assets that may not be in the best interest of our stockholders. Furthermore, because our Advisor and its affiliates
do not maintain a significant equity interest in us and are entitled to receive substantial minimum compensation regardless of
performance, their interests are not wholly aligned with those of our stockholders.</P>

amortization and bad debt reserves, incentive fees paid in compliance with the NASAA REIT Guidelines, acquisition fees and acquisition
expenses, real estate commissions on the sale of property and other fees and expenses connected with the acquisition, disposition,
management and ownership of real estate interests, mortgage loans or other property (including the costs of foreclosure, insurance
premiums, legal services, maintenance, repair and improvement of property). In that regard, our Advisor could be motivated to recommend
riskier or more speculative investments in order for us to generate the specified levels of performance or sales proceeds that
would entitle our Advisor to fees. In addition, our Advisor&rsquo;s or its affiliates&rsquo; entitlement to fees upon the sale
of our assets could result in our Advisor recommending sales of our investments even if continued ownership of those investments
might be in our best long-term interest. Furthermore, our Sponsor has the right to convert its Sponsor Preferred Shares into Common
Shares upon (and for 180 days following) the sale or transfer of substantially all of our assets, stock or business (other than
a sale of assets in our liquidation, dissolution or winding up), the listing of our Common Shares on any national securities exchange
or the termination or expiration without renewal of the advisory agreement. To avoid enabling our Sponsor to convert its Sponsor
Preferred Shares into Common Shares, our independent directors may decide against any of such events even if, but for the conversion
of the Sponsor Preferred Shares into Common Shares, such an event would be in our best interest. For a more detailed discussion
of the fees payable to our Advisor and its affiliates in respect of our IPO, see the section of our prospectus titled &ldquo;Compensation

investments or other co-ownership arrangements with other programs sponsored by affiliates of our Advisor for the acquisition,
development or improvement of properties as well as the acquisition of real estate-related investments. The executive officers
of our Advisor and URP are also the executive officers of other real estate investment vehicles, and may in the future sponsor
or be the executive officers of other REITs and their advisors, the general partners of other United Realty-sponsored partnerships
or the advisors or fiduciaries of other United Realty-sponsored programs. These executive officers will face conflicts of interest
in determining which United Realty-sponsored program should enter into any particular joint venture, tenant-in-common or co-ownership
arrangement. These persons also may have a conflict in structuring the terms of the relationship between our interests and the
interests of the United Realty-sponsored co-venturer, co-tenant or partner as well as conflicts of interest in managing the joint
venture. Further, the fiduciary obligations that our Advisor or our board of directors may owe to a co-venturer, co-tenant or partner
affiliated with our Sponsor or Advisor may make it more difficult for us to enforce our rights. If we enter into a joint venture,
tenant-in-common investment or other co-ownership arrangement with another program (whether sponsored by us or by the principal
of our Sponsor or his affiliates) or joint venture, our advisor and its affiliates may have a conflict of interest when determining
when and whether to buy or sell a particular real estate property, exercise buy/sell rights or make other major decisions, and
you may face certain additional risks. For example, if we become listed for trading on a national securities exchange, and any
of the other programs sponsored by us or our Sponsor&rsquo;s principal or his affiliates are not traded on any exchange, we
may develop more divergent goals and objectives from such joint venturer with respect to the sale of properties in the future.
In addition, if we enter into a joint venture with another program sponsored by us or the principal of our Sponsor or his affiliates
that has a term shorter than ours, the joint venture may be required to sell its properties at the time of the other program&rsquo;s
liquidation. We may not desire to sell the properties at such time. Even if the terms of any joint venture agreement between us
and another program sponsored by us or the principal of our Sponsor or his affiliates grant us a right of first refusal to buy
such properties, we may not have sufficient funds to exercise our right of first refusal under these circumstances.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Because Mr. Frydman and his affiliates control
us and would control any other United Realty-sponsored programs, agreements and transactions among the parties with respect to
any joint venture, tenant-in-common investment or other co-ownership arrangement between or among such parties will not have the
benefit of arm&rsquo;s-length negotiation of the type normally conducted between unrelated co-venturers. Under these joint ventures,
neither co-venturer may have the power to control the venture, and under certain circumstances, an impasse could be reached regarding
matters pertaining to the co-ownership arrangement, which might have a negative influence on the joint venture and decrease potential
returns to you. If a co-venturer has a right of first refusal to buy out the other co-venturer, it may be unable to finance such
buyout at that time. If our interest is subject to a buy/sell right, we may not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity
or other capital resources to allow us to elect to purchase an interest of a co-venturer subject to the buy/sell right, in which
case we may be forced to sell our interest as the result of the exercise of such right when we would otherwise prefer to keep our
interest. Furthermore, we may not be able to sell our interest in a joint venture if we desire to exit the venture for any reason
or if our interest is likewise subject to a right of first refusal of our co-venturer or partner, our ability to sell such interest
may be adversely impacted by such right.</P>

respect to investments we acquire; such fee may be calculated as a percentage of the debt attributable to such investment. Further,
if our Advisor provides services in connection with the origination or refinancing of any debt that we obtain and use, directly
or indirectly, to finance properties or other investments, or that we assume, directly or indirectly, in connection with the acquisition
of properties or other investments, we will pay our Advisor or its assignees a financing coordination fee equal to 1% of the amount

to prevent our Advisor and URP from receiving both acquisition-related fees and financing-related fees with respect to the amount

of stock that would entitle the acquirer to exercise voting power in electing directors within specified ranges of voting power.
Control shares do not include shares the acquiring person is then entitled to vote as a result of having previously obtained stockholder
approval. A &ldquo;control share acquisition&rdquo; means the acquisition of issued and outstanding control shares. The control
share acquisition statute does not apply (a) to shares acquired in a merger, consolidation or share exchange if the corporation

contain a provision exempting from the control share acquisition statute any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of our

directly and through wholly owned or majority-owned subsidiaries, so that the company and each of its subsidiaries is not an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Under Section 3(a)(1)(A) of the Investment Company Act, a company is deemed to be an
&ldquo;investment company&rdquo; if it is, or holds itself out as being, engaged primarily, or proposes to engage primarily, in
the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. Under Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company Act, a company
is deemed to be an &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; if it is engaged, or proposes to engage, in the business of investing, reinvesting,
owning, holding or trading in securities and owns or propose to acquire &ldquo;investment securities&rdquo; having a value exceeding
40% of the value of its total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Rule 3a-1
under the Investment Company Act, however, generally provides that, notwithstanding Section 3(a)(1)(C) of the Investment Company
Act, an issuer will not be deemed to be an &ldquo;investment company&rdquo; under the Investment Company Act; provided, that (a)
it does not hold itself out as being engaged primarily, or propose to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting
or trading in securities, and (b) on an unconsolidated basis no more than 45% of the value of its total assets, consolidated with
the assets of any wholly owned subsidiary (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items), consists of, and no more than
45% of its net income after taxes, consolidated with the net income of any wholly owned subsidiary (for the last four fiscal quarters
combined), is derived from, securities other than U.S. government securities, securities issued by employees&rsquo; securities
companies, securities issued by certain majority-owned subsidiaries of such company and securities issued by certain companies
that are controlled primarily by such company. We believe that we, the OP and the subsidiaries of the OP will satisfy this exclusion.</P>

cause us or one or more of our wholly or majority-owned subsidiaries to fall within the definition of &ldquo;investment company&rdquo;

to register the company or any of its subsidiaries as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be unable
to sell assets we would otherwise want to sell and may need to sell assets we would otherwise wish to retain. In addition, we may
have to acquire additional income- or loss-generating assets that we might not otherwise have acquired or may have to forgo opportunities
to acquire interests in companies that we would otherwise want to acquire and would be important to our investment strategy. Our
Advisor will continually review our investment activity to attempt to ensure that we will not be regulated as an investment company.</P>

partnership interests of the OP. In addition, the operating partnership agreement for the OP contains provisions that allow, under
certain circumstances, other entities, including other United Realty-sponsored programs, to merge into or cause the exchange or
conversion of their interest for interests of the OP. Because the limited partnership interests in the OP may be exchanged for

considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available
to fund our cash needs, including our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Neither the SEC nor any other regulatory

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">There are many factors that can affect the availability
and timing of cash distributions to stockholders. Distributions generally will be based upon such factors as the amount of cash
available or anticipated to be available from real estate investments and real estate-related securities, mortgage, bridge or mezzanine
loans and other investments, current and projected cash requirements and tax considerations. Because we may receive income from
interest or rents at various times during our fiscal year, distributions paid may not reflect our income earned in that particular
distribution period. The amount of cash available for distributions will be affected by many factors, such as our ability to make
acquisitions as offering proceeds become available, the income from those investments and yields on securities of other real estate
programs that we invest in, and our operating expense levels, as well as many other variables. Actual cash available for distributions
may vary substantially from estimates. We can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve our anticipated cash flow or that
distributions will increase over time. Nor can we give any assurance that rents from the properties will increase, that the securities
we buy will increase in value or provide constant or increased distributions over time, that loans we make will be repaid or paid
on time, that loans will generate the interest payments that we expect, or that future acquisitions of real properties, mortgage,
bridge or mezzanine loans, other investments or our investments in securities will increase our cash available for distributions
to stockholders. Our actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used by our board of directors in establishing
the distribution rates to stockholders.</P>

tenants in any properties we own to experience financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, insolvency or a general downturn in
their business. We cannot assure you that any tenant that files for bankruptcy protection will continue to pay us rent. A bankruptcy
filing by, or relating to, one of our tenants or a lease guarantor would bar efforts by us to collect pre-bankruptcy debts from
that tenant or lease guarantor, or its property, unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court. In
addition, we cannot evict a tenant solely because of bankruptcy. The bankruptcy of a tenant or lease guarantor could delay our
efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases, and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums. If a lease
is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy, all pre-bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full. If, however,
a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy, we would have only a general, unsecured claim for damages. An unsecured claim would
only be paid to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of general,
unsecured claims. Restrictions under the bankruptcy laws further limit the amount of any other claims that we can make if a lease
is rejected. As a result, it is likely that we would recover substantially less than the full value of the remaining rent during
the term.</P>

Services (&rsquo;S&amp;P&rsquo;) downgraded the U.S. government&rsquo;s AAA sovereign credit rating to AA+ with a negative outlook
and downgraded the credit ratings of certain long-term debt instruments issued by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and other U.S.&nbsp;government
agencies linked to long-term U.S. debt. Moody&rsquo;s Investors Service, Inc. (&lsquo;Moody&rsquo;s&rsquo;) changed its outlook

28, 2011. On June 10, 2013, S&amp;P changed its outlook from negative to stable. However, it has not raised its credit rating from
AA+ and cautioned that policy makers could place downwards pressure on the rating if they relax fiscal policy without addressing
longer-term fiscal challenges. On June 28, 2013, Fitch affirmed the U.S. government credit rating at AAA but kept its outlook at
negative, stating still-elevated debt levels leave the country vulnerable to shocks without deficit reduction. On July 19, 2013,
Moody&rsquo;s raised its outlook on the U.S. government to stable and restored its top rating of Aaa. There continues to be a perceived
risk of future sovereign credit ratings downgrade of the U.S. government, including the ratings of U.S. Treasury securities. A

of funding for some European financial institutions. These recent events may reduce investor confidence and lead to further weakening
of the U.S. and global economies. In particular, this could cause disruption in the capital markets and impact the stability of
future U.S. Treasury auctions and the trading market for U.S. government securities, resulting in increased interest rates and
borrowing costs. In addition, the evolving efforts to correct the market instability make the valuation of real estate assets highly
unpredictable. The fluctuation in market conditions may make judging the future performance of real estate assets difficult. There

risk occurs when the index upon which the contract is based is more or less variable than the index upon which the hedged asset
or liability is based, thereby making the hedge less effective. Finally, legal enforceability risks encompass general contractual
risks, including the risk that the counterparty will breach the terms of, or fail to perform its obligations under, the derivative
contract. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make
distributions to you will be adversely affected.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">The cost of using hedging instruments increases
as the period covered by the instrument increases and during periods of rising and volatile interest rates. We may increase our
hedging activity and thus increase our hedging costs during periods when interest rates are volatile or rising and hedging costs
have increased. In addition, hedging instruments involve risk since they often are not traded on regulated exchanges, guaranteed
by an exchange or its clearing house, or regulated by any U.S. or foreign governmental authorities. Consequently, there are no
requirements with respect to recordkeeping, financial responsibility or segregation of customer funds and positions. Furthermore,
the enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable statutory, commodity
and other regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The
business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in a default.
Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized profits and force us to cover
our resale commitments, if any, at the then-current market price. It may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging
position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter into an offsetting contract in order
to cover our risk. We cannot be certain that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and
we may be required to maintain a position until exercise or expiration, which could result in losses.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are major sources of
financing for the multifamily sector. Since 2007, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have reported substantial losses and a need for significant
amounts of additional capital. In response to the deteriorating financial condition of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the recent
credit market disruption, the U.S. Congress and Treasury undertook a series of actions to stabilize these government-sponsored
enterprises and the financial markets. Pursuant to legislation enacted in 2008, the U.S. government placed both Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac under its conservatorship.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Currently, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain active
multifamily lenders. However, there is significant uncertainty surrounding the futures of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Should Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac have their mandates changed or reduced, be disbanded or reorganized by the government or otherwise discontinue
providing liquidity to our sector, it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital or increase borrowing costs. If new
U.S. government regulations heighten Fannie Mae&rsquo;s and Freddie Mac&rsquo;s underwriting standards, adversely affect interest
rates and reduce the amount of capital they can make available to the multifamily sector, it could have a material adverse effect
on both the multifamily sector and us because many private alternative sources of funding have been reduced or are unavailable.
Any potential reduction in loans, guarantees and credit-enhancement arrangements from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could jeopardize
the effectiveness of the multifamily sector&rsquo;s derivative securities market, potentially causing breaches in loan covenants,
and through reduced loan availability, impact the value of multifamily assets, which could impair the value of a significant portion
of multifamily communities. Specifically, the potential for a decrease in liquidity made available to the multifamily sector by
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could: (a) make it more difficult for us to secure takeout financing for multifamily development projects;
(b) hinder our ability to refinance completed multifamily assets; (c) decrease the amount of available liquidity and credit that
could be used to diversify a portfolio of multifamily assets; and (d) require us to obtain other sources of debt capital with potentially
different terms.</P>

estate-related asset investments will initially be valued at cost, and thereafter will be valued at least annually, or in the case
of liquid securities, daily, as applicable, at fair value as determined by our Advisor. See the section of our prospectus titled
&ldquo;Valuation Policies.&rdquo; The valuation methodologies used to value our properties will involve subjective judgments concerning
factors such as comparable sales, rental and operating expense data, capitalization or discount rate, and projections of future

because such prices would be negotiated. We will not retroactively adjust the valuation of such assets, the price of our Common

the NAV pricing start date the price of Common Shares under our DRIP and the price at which your Common Shares may be repurchased

that approximately 25% of all properties are appraised each quarter. We anticipate that such appraisals will be conducted near
the end of the calendar quarter in which they occur. Therefore, when these appraisals are reflected in our NAV calculation, there
may be a sudden change in our NAV per Common Share. In addition, actual operating results for a given month may differ from our
original estimate, which may affect our NAV per Common Share for purposes of our DRIP and our share repurchase program. We will
base our calculation of estimated income and expenses on a monthly budget. As soon as practicable after the end of each month,
we will adjust the estimated income and expenses to reflect the income and expenses actually earned and incurred. We will not retroactively
adjust the daily NAV per Common Share for the previous month. Therefore, because the actual results from operations may be better
or worse than what we previously budgeted for a particular month, the adjustment to reflect actual operating results may cause

for acquiring properties may involve the acquisition of properties in markets that are depressed or overbuilt, or have high growth
potential in real estate lease rates and sale prices. As a result of our investment in these types of markets, we will face increased
risks relating to changes in local market conditions and increased competition for similar properties in the same market, as well
as increased risks that these markets will not recover and the value of our properties in these markets will not increase, or will
decrease, over time. For these and other reasons, we cannot assure you that we will be profitable or that we will realize growth
in the value of our real estate properties, and as a result, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be affected.

cause us to reduce the amount of distributions to stockholders. A default by a significant tenant on its lease payments to us would
cause us to lose the revenue associated with such lease and cause us to have to find an alternative source of revenue to meet mortgage
payments and prevent a foreclosure if the property is subject to a mortgage. If there is a tenant default, we may experience delays
in enforcing our rights as landlord and may incur substantial costs in protecting our investment and re-letting our property. If
significant leases are terminated, we cannot assure you that we will be able to lease the property for the rent previously received
or sell the property without incurring a loss. Additionally, loans that we make generally will relate to real estate. As a result,

we may acquire will expose us and our operators to potential liability for personal injuries and, in certain instances, property
damage claims. For instance, there are types of losses, generally catastrophic in nature, such as losses due to wars, acts of terrorism,
earthquakes, pollution, environmental matters or extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods and snow storms that are
uninsurable or not economically insurable, or may be insured subject to limitations, such as large deductibles or co-payments.
Insurance risks associated with potential terrorist acts could sharply increase the premiums we pay for coverage against property
and casualty claims. Mortgage lenders generally insist that specific coverage against terrorism be purchased by commercial property
owners as a condition for providing mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans. It is uncertain whether such insurance policies will be
available, or available at reasonable cost, which could inhibit our ability to finance or refinance our properties. In such instances,
we may be required to provide other financial support, either through financial assurances or self-insurance, to cover potential
losses. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate coverage for such losses. If any of our properties incurs a casualty loss
that is not fully covered by insurance, the value of our assets will be reduced by the amount of any such uninsured loss. In addition,
other than the capital reserve or other reserves we may establish, we have no source of funding to repair or reconstruct any uninsured
damaged property, and we cannot assure you that any such sources of funding will be available to us for such purposes in the future.
Also, to the extent we must pay unexpectedly large amounts for insurance, we could suffer reduced earnings that would result in
decreased distributions to stockholders.</P>

The builder&rsquo;s failure to perform may necessitate legal action by us to rescind the purchase or the construction contract
or to compel performance. Performance also may be affected or delayed by conditions beyond the builder&rsquo;s control. Delays
in completion of construction also could give tenants the right to terminate preconstruction leases for space at a newly developed

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">From time to time, we may attempt to acquire multiple
properties in a single transaction. Portfolio acquisitions are more complex and expensive than single-property acquisitions, and
the risk that a multiple-property acquisition does not close may be greater than in a single-property acquisition. Portfolio acquisitions
also may result in us owning investments in geographically dispersed markets, placing additional demands on our ability to manage
the properties in the portfolio. In addition, a seller may require that a group of properties be purchased as a package even though
we may not want to purchase one or more properties in the portfolio. In these situations, if we are unable to identify another
person or entity to acquire the unwanted properties, we may be required to operate or attempt to dispose of these properties. To
acquire multiple properties in a single transaction we may be required to accumulate a large amount of cash. We would expect the
returns that we earn on such cash to be less than the ultimate returns in real property and therefore, accumulating such cash could
reduce the funds available for distributions. Any of the foregoing events may have an adverse effect on our operations.</P>

laws provide for sanctions for noncompliance and may be enforced by governmental agencies or, in certain circumstances, by private

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Under current authoritative accounting guidance
for leases, a lease is classified by a tenant as a capital lease if the significant risks and rewards of ownership are considered
to reside with the tenant. Under capital lease accounting for a tenant, both the leased asset and liability are reflected on its
balance sheet. If the lease does not meet any of the criteria for a capital lease, the lease is considered an operating lease by
the tenant, and the obligation does not appear on the tenant&rsquo;s balance sheet; rather, the contractual future minimum payment
obligations are only disclosed in the footnotes thereto. Thus, entering into an operating lease can appear to enhance a tenant&rsquo;s
balance sheet in comparison to direct ownership. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the &ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) and the International
Accounting Standards Board (the &ldquo;IASB&rdquo;) conducted a joint project to re-evaluate lease accounting. In August 2010,
the FASB and the IASB jointly released exposure drafts of a proposed accounting model that would significantly change lease accounting.
The exposure drafts have gone through several rounds of public comment and are not yet final. Changes to the accounting guidance
could affect both our accounting for leases as well as that of our current and potential tenants. These changes may affect how
the real estate leasing business is conducted. For example, if the accounting standards regarding the financial statement classification
of operating leases are revised, then companies may be less willing to enter into leases in general or desire to enter into leases
with shorter terms because the apparent benefits to their balance sheets could be reduced or eliminated. This in turn could cause
a delay in investing our offering proceeds and make it more difficult for us to enter into leases on terms we find favorable.</P>

Act of 1988 (the &ldquo;FHAA&rdquo;) which requires that apartment communities first occupied after March 13, 1991 be accessible
to handicapped residents and visitors. Compliance with the FHAA could require removal of structural barriers to handicapped access
in a community, including the interiors of apartment units covered under the FHAA. Recently there has been heightened scrutiny
of multifamily housing communities for compliance with the requirements of the FHAA and an increasing number of substantial enforcement
actions and private lawsuits have been brought against apartment communities to ensure compliance with these requirements. Noncompliance
with the FHAA could result in the imposition of fines, awards of damages to private litigants, payment of attorneys&rsquo; fees
and other costs to plaintiffs, substantial litigation costs and substantial costs of remediation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">If there is a shortfall in cash flow available
to service our mortgage debt, then the amount available for distributions to stockholders may be affected. In addition, incurring
mortgage debt increases the risk of loss because (a) loss in investment value is generally borne entirely by the borrower until
such time as the investment value declines below the principal balance of the associated debt, and (b) defaults on indebtedness
secured by a property may result in foreclosure actions initiated by lenders and our loss of the property securing the loan that
is in default. For tax purposes, a foreclosure of any of our properties would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase
price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage. If the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the
mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property, we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure, but would not receive any cash
proceeds from the foreclosure. We may give full or partial guarantees to lenders of mortgage debt to the entities that own our
properties. When we give a guaranty on behalf of an entity that owns one of our properties, we will be responsible to the lender
for satisfaction of the debt if it is not paid by such entity. If any mortgages contain cross-collateralization or cross-default
provisions, there is a risk that more than one real property may be affected by a default. If any of our properties is foreclosed
upon due to a default, our ability to make distributions to our stockholders will be adversely affected. In addition, because our
goal (which may not be achieved) is to be in a position to liquidate our assets within six to nine years after the termination
of our IPO, our approach to investing in properties utilizing leverage in order to accomplish our investment objectives over this
period of time may present more risks to investors than comparable real estate programs that have a longer intended duration and
that do not utilize borrowing to the same degree.</P>

will be required either to make scheduled payments of amortized principal and interest or to make a lump-sum or &ldquo;balloon&rdquo;
payment at maturity. These required principal or balloon payments will increase the amount of our scheduled payments and may increase
our risk of default under the related mortgage loan. If the mortgage loan has an adjustable interest rate, the amount of our scheduled
payments also may increase at a time of rising interest rates. Increased payments and substantial principal or balloon maturity
payments will reduce the funds available for distribution to our stockholders because cash otherwise available for distribution

market interest rates will change relative to the current yield on fixed-income securities such as preferred and debt securities,
and to a lesser extent dividend-paying common stock. Generally, when interest rates rise, the market value of these securities
declines, and vice versa. In addition, when interest rates fall, issuers are more likely to repurchase their existing preferred
and debt securities to take advantage of the lower cost of financing. As repurchases occur, principal is returned to the holders
of the securities sooner than expected, thereby lowering the effective yield on the investment. On the other hand, when interest
rates rise, issuers are more likely to maintain their existing preferred and debt securities. As a result, repurchases decrease,
thereby extending the average maturity of the securities. If we are unable to manage interest rate risk effectively, our results

not be able to make new loans at the previously higher interest rate. If we invest in variable-rate loans and interest rates decrease,
our revenues also may decrease. Finally, if we invest in variable-rate loans and interest rates increase, the value of the loans
we own at such time would decrease, which would lower the proceeds we would receive if we sell such assets. For these reasons,
if we invest in mortgage, bridge or mezzanine loans, our returns on those loans and the value of your investment will be subject
to fluctuations in interest rates.</P>

regulations and is subject to many of the delays and expenses of any lawsuit brought in connection with the foreclosure if the
defendant raises defenses or counterclaims. If there is a default by a mortgagor, these restrictions, among other things, may impede
our ability to foreclose on or sell the mortgaged property or to obtain proceeds sufficient to repay all amounts due to us on the

form of subordinated loans secured by second mortgages on the underlying real property or loans secured by a pledge of the ownership
interests of either the entity owning the real property or the entity that owns the interest in the entity owning the real property.
These types of investments involve a higher degree of risk than long-term senior mortgage lending secured by income- producing
real property because the investment may become unsecured as a result of foreclosure by the senior lender. If borrowers of these
loans are real estate developers, our investments may involve additional risks, including dependence for repayment on successful
completion and operation of the project, difficulties in estimating construction or rehabilitation costs and loan terms that often
require little or no amortization. If there is a bankruptcy of the entity providing the pledge of its ownership interests as security,
we may not have full recourse to the assets of the entity, or the assets of the entity may not be sufficient to satisfy our mezzanine
loan. If a borrower defaults on our loan or on debt senior to our loan, or if there is a borrower bankruptcy, our loan will be
satisfied only after the senior debt is paid in full. Where debt senior to our loan exists, the presence of intercreditor arrangements
may limit our ability to amend our loan documents, assign our loans, accept prepayments, exercise our remedies (through &ldquo;standstill

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">We intend to elect and qualify to be taxed as
a REIT commencing with our taxable year ending December 31, 2013 and intend to operate in a manner that would allow us to continue
to qualify as a REIT. However, we inadvertently filed a U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 2011
on IRS Form 1120-REIT, which was treated as having made our REIT election commencing with that tax year. In 2012, we failed to
qualify as a REIT. We have filed for relief from the IRS so that we will not be treated as having made our REIT election for our
tax year ended December 31, 2011. It is solely within the discretion of the IRS to grant the relief sought by us. Subsequent to
making our REIT election, we may terminate our REIT qualification, if our board of directors determines that not qualifying as
a REIT is in our best interests, or inadvertently. Our qualification as a REIT depends upon our satisfaction of certain asset,
income, organizational, distribution, stockholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. The REIT qualification
requirements are extremely complex and interpretation of the U.S. federal income tax laws governing qualification as a REIT is
limited. Our ability to satisfy the asset tests depends on our analysis of the characterization and fair market values of our assets,
some of which are not susceptible to a precise determination, and for which we will not obtain independent appraisals. Our compliance
with the REIT income or quarterly asset requirements also depends on our ability to successfully manage the composition of our
income and assets on an ongoing basis. Accordingly, if certain of our operations were to be recharacterized by the IRS, such recharacterization
would jeopardize our ability to satisfy all the requirements for qualification as a REIT. Furthermore, future legislative, judicial
or administrative changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws could be applied retroactively, which could result in our disqualification
as a REIT.</P>

year, (including as a result of the IRS not granting our request for relief in connection with the REIT election we inadvertently

to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates. In addition, we would generally be disqualified from treatment
as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year of losing our REIT qualification. Losing our REIT qualification would reduce
our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders because of the additional tax liability. In addition,
distributions to stockholders would no longer qualify for the dividends paid deduction, and we would no longer be required to make
distributions. If this occurs, we might be required to borrow funds or liquidate some investments in order to pay the applicable
tax.</P>

sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes applicable to REITs. We also may decide to retain net capital gain we earn from
the sale or other disposition of our property and pay U.S. federal income tax directly on such income. In that event, our stockholders
would be treated as if they earned that income and paid the tax on it directly. However, stockholders that are tax-exempt, such
as charities or qualified pension plans, would have no benefit from their deemed payment of such tax liability unless they file
U.S. federal income tax returns and thereon seek a refund of such tax. We also may be subject to state and local taxes on our income

a TRS to operate a &ldquo;qualified lodging facility,&rdquo; is actively engaged in the trade or business of operating &ldquo;qualified
lodging facilities&rdquo; for any person not related, as defined in the Code, to us or the TRS. Among other requirements, in order
to qualify as an independent contractor a manager must not own, directly or applying attribution provisions of the Code, more than
35% of our outstanding shares of stock (by value), and no person or group of persons can own more than 35% of our outstanding shares
and 35% of the ownership interests of the manager (taking into account only owners of more than 5% of our shares and, with respect

ownership attribution rules that apply for purposes of the 35% thresholds are complex and, there can be no assurance that the ownership
of our stock by our managers and their owners will not exceed these thresholds.</P>

2003-65, the IRS provided a safe harbor pursuant to which a mezzanine loan that is not secured by real estate would, if it meets
each of the requirements contained in the Revenue Procedure, be treated by the IRS as a qualifying real estate asset. Although
the Revenue Procedure provides a safe harbor on which taxpayers may rely, it does not prescribe rules of substantive tax law and
in many cases it may not be possible for us to meet all the requirements of the safe harbor. We cannot provide assurance that any

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">In connection with our qualification as a REIT,
we are required to annually distribute to our stockholders at least 90% of our taxable income (which does not equal net income,
as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital
gain. In order to satisfy this requirement, we may make distributions that are payable in cash or Common Shares (which could account
for up to 80% of the aggregate amount of such distributions) at the election of each stockholder. Taxable stockholders receiving
such distributions will be required to include the full amount of such distributions as ordinary dividend income to the extent
of our current or accumulated earnings and profits, as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. As a result, U.S. stockholders
may be required to pay income taxes with respect to such distributions in excess of the cash portion of the distribution received.
Accordingly, U.S. stockholders receiving a distribution of our shares may be required to sell shares received in such distribution
or may be required to sell other stock or assets owned by them, at a time that may be disadvantageous, in order to satisfy any
tax imposed on such distribution. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock that it receives as part of the distribution in order to
pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount it must include in income with respect to the distribution, depending
on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to certain non-U.S. stockholders, we may be
required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such distribution, including in respect of all or a portion of such distribution
that is payable in stock, by withholding or disposing of part of the shares included in such distribution and using the proceeds
of such disposition to satisfy the withholding tax imposed. In addition, if a significant number of our stockholders determine
to sell our Common Shares in order to pay taxes owed on dividend income, such sale may put downward pressure on the market price
of our Common Shares.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">No public market currently exists for our Common
Shares, and we currently have no plans to list our Common Shares on a national securities exchange. Until our Common Shares are
listed, if ever, our stockholders may not sell their Common Shares unless the buyer meets the applicable suitability and minimum
purchase requirements. In addition, our charter prohibits the ownership of more than 9.8% in value of the aggregate of our outstanding
shares or more than 9.8% (in value or number of shares, whichever is more restrictive) of our outstanding Common Shares, unless
exempted by our board of directors. Consequently, there is the risk that our stockholders may not be able to sell their Common
Shares at a time or price acceptable to them. Pursuant to our IPO, we are selling Common Shares at $10.45 per Common Share, and
inclusive of dealer manager fees and selling commissions, although discounts are available for certain categories of purchasers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">In order for Financial Industry Regulatory Authority,
Inc. (&ldquo;FINRA&rdquo;) members and their associated persons to participate in the offering and sale of Common Shares pursuant
to our IPO, we are required pursuant to FINRA Rule 2310(b)(5) to disclose in each annual report distributed to stockholders a per
share estimated value of the Common Shares, the method by which it was developed and the date of the data used to develop the estimated
value. In addition, we prepare annual statements of estimated share value to assist fiduciaries of retirement plans subject to
the annual reporting requirements of ERISA in the preparation of their reports relating to an investment in our Common Shares.
During our IPO, the value of the Common Shares is deemed to be the offering price of $10.45 per Common Share. There is no public
trading market for the Common Shares at this time, and there can be no assurance that stockholders would receive $10.45 per Common
Share if such a market did exist and they sold their Common Shares or that they will be able to receive such amount for their Common
Shares in the future. Nor does this deemed value reflect the distributions that stockholders would be entitled to receive if our
properties were sold and the sales proceeds were distributed upon liquidation of our Company. Such a distribution upon liquidation
may be less than $10.45 per Common Share primarily due to the fact that the funds initially available for investment in properties
will have been reduced from the gross offering proceeds in order to pay selling commissions and dealer manager fees, organization
and offering expenses, and acquisition and asset management fees.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">On December 28, 2012, our board of directors declared daily distributions
on our Common Shares at a daily rate of $0.00210958904 per Common Share. The distributions began to accrue as of daily record dates
beginning on January 1, 2013, and are aggregated and paid monthly, on payment dates determined by us, to stockholders who hold
Common Shares as of such daily record dates. We expect to continue paying distributions monthly unless our results of operations,
our general financial condition, general economic conditions or other factors make it imprudent to do so. The timing and amount
of distributions will be determined by our board and will be influenced in part by its intention to comply with REIT requirements
of the Code.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">We expect to have little, if any, funds from operations available
for distribution until we make substantial investments. Further, because we may receive income from interest or rents at various
times during our fiscal year and because we may need funds from operations during a particular period to fund capital expenditures
and other expenses, we expect that at least during the early stages of our development and from time to time during our operational
stage, our board will authorize and we will declare distributions in anticipation of funds that we expect to receive during a later
period and we will pay these distributions in advance of our actual receipt of these funds. In these instances, we expect to look
to proceeds from our IPO or from the issuance of securities in the future, or to third-party borrowings, to fund our distributions.
We also may fund such distributions from advances from our Sponsor or from any waiver of fees by our Advisor.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Our board has the authority under our organizational documents,
to the extent permitted by Maryland law, to authorize the payment of distributions from any source without limits, including proceeds

our existence, we will use the proceeds of our IPO to pay distributions.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">To maintain our qualification as a REIT, we generally are required
to make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does not equal net
income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding any
net capital gain. If we meet the REIT qualification requirements, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on
that portion of our taxable income or capital gain which is distributed to our stockholders.</P>

sold 500,000 shares of preferred stock, subsequently exchanged for 500,000 Sponsor Preferred Shares, to our Sponsor under Regulation
D at a price of $0.10 per share for aggregate gross proceeds of $50,000, which also was used to fund organizational costs. Our
Sponsor has the right to convert its Sponsor Preferred Shares into Common Shares upon (and for 180 days following) the sale or
transfer of substantially all of our assets, stock or business (other than a sale of assets in our liquidation, dissolution or
winding up), the listing of our Common Shares on any national securities exchange or the termination or expiration without renewal
of the advisory agreement. If the Sponsor Preferred Shares become convertible into Common Shares, each outstanding Sponsor Preferred
Share may be converted into one Common Share for each $100 million, rounded down to the nearest $100&nbsp;million, of gross proceeds
raised by us through the date of conversion in our IPO and any subsequent public offering of Common Shares, combined.</P>

<P STYLE="font: bold 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Our Common Shares are not listed on a national
securities exchange and we will not seek to list our Common Shares until the time, if such time ever occurs, that our independent
directors believe that the listing of our Common Shares would be in the best interest of our stockholders. Stockholders who have
held their Common Shares for at least one year may make daily requests that we repurchase all or a portion (but generally at least
25%) of their Common Shares pursuant to our share repurchase program, but we may not be able to fulfill all repurchase requests.
Prior to the NAV pricing start date, stockholders may have their Common Shares repurchased (a) in the case of hardship, at the
total offering price paid, or (b) in the sole discretion of our Advisor, at a price of 92% of the total offering price paid, but
in neither event at a price greater than the offering price per Common Share under our DRIP. Following the NAV pricing start date,
the repurchase price per Common Share on any business day will be 95% of our NAV per Common Share for that day, calculated after
the close of business on the repurchase request day, without giving effect to any share purchases or repurchases to be effected
on such day; provided, however, that while the primary offering is ongoing, in no event will the repurchase price following the
NAV pricing start date exceed the then-current offering price under the primary offering.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Prior to the NAV pricing start date, we will limit
the Common Shares repurchased during any calendar quarter to 1.25% of the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding
during the previous calendar quarter, or approximately 5% of the weighted average number of Common Shares outstanding in any 12-month
period. Following the NAV pricing start date, we will limit Common Shares repurchased during any calendar quarter to 5% of our
NAV as of the last day of the previous calendar quarter or as of the NAV pricing start date if it occurred during the then-current
quarter, or approximately 20% of our NAV in any 12-month period. Our Advisor will evaluate our capital needs and the amount of
available cash and other liquid assets (as defined below) each quarter and may elect to increase the amount available for repurchase
during such quarter.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">In addition, stockholders will only be able to
repurchase their Common Shares to the extent that we have sufficient liquid assets (as defined below). Most of our assets will
consist of properties which cannot generally be readily liquidated without impacting our ability to realize full value upon their
disposition. We may not always have sufficient liquid resources to satisfy all repurchase requests. In order to provide liquidity
for repurchases, we intend to maintain the following percentage of the overall value of our portfolio in cash, cash equivalents
and other short-term investments and certain types of real estate related assets that can be liquidated more readily than properties
(collectively, &ldquo;liquid assets&rdquo;): (A) 15% of our NAV up to $333 million; (B) 10% of our NAV between $333 million and
$667 million; and (C) 5% of our NAV in excess of $667 million. In addition, our board of directors may decide, but is not obligated,
to maintain borrowing capacity under a line of credit.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Our board of directors in its discretion may
modify, suspend or terminate our share repurchase program for any reason. As of December 31, 2013, there were approximately
183,588 Common Shares eligible for repurchase which are subject to the limitations noted above. As of December 31, 2013, we
had received no repurchase requests.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">We were formed in November 2011 for the purpose
of investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate properties and other real estate-related assets.
We intend to elect and qualify as a REIT beginning with the taxable year ended December 31, 2013.&nbsp;However, we inadvertently
filed a U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year ending December 31, 2011 on Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, Form 1120-REIT,
which may be treated as having made our REIT election commencing with that tax year. We have filed for relief from the IRS so that
we will not be treated as having made our REIT election prior to our tax year ending December 31, 2013. It is solely within the
discretion of the IRS to grant the relief sought by us. If we are unable to obtain the relief we seek from the IRS, generally we
would be unable to make our REIT election until the fifth taxable year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a REIT.
We conduct substantially all of our investment activities and own all of our assets through the OP, of which we are the sole general
partner and a limited partner. United Realty Advisors LP, a Delaware limited partnership (our &ldquo;Advisor&rdquo;) manages our
day-to-day operations and our portfolio of properties and real estate-related assets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">On August 15, 2012, our Registration Statement was declared effective
by the SEC. The Registration Statement covers our initial public offering of up to 120,000,000 Common Shares, consisting of up
to 100,000,000 Common Shares in our primary offering on a &ldquo;best efforts&rdquo; basis and up to 20,000,000 Common Shares pursuant

in excess of the minimum of 200,000 Common Shares, broke escrow and issued Common Shares to our initial investors, who were admitted
as stockholders. As of December 31, 2013 we had sold 643,730 Common Shares for gross offering proceeds of approximately $6.7 million
and net offering proceeds of $6.1 million.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">We are dependent upon the net proceeds from our IPO to conduct our
proposed operations. We have obtained and will continue to obtain the capital required to purchase properties and other investments
and conduct our operations from the proceeds of our IPO and any future offerings we may conduct, from secured or unsecured financings
from banks and other lenders and from any undistributed funds from our operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">If we are unable to raise substantial funds in our IPO, we will
make fewer investments resulting in less diversification in terms of the type, number and size of investments we make and the value
of an investment in us will fluctuate with the performance of the specific assets we acquire. Further, we will have certain fixed
operating expenses, including certain expenses as a publicly offered REIT, regardless of whether we are able to raise substantial
funds in our IPO. Our inability to raise substantial funds would increase our fixed operating expenses as a percentage of gross
income, reducing our net income and limiting our ability to make distributions. We do not expect to establish a permanent reserve
from our offering proceeds for maintenance and repairs of real properties, as we expect the majority of leases for the properties
we acquire will provide for tenant reimbursement of operating expenses. However, to the extent that we have insufficient funds
for such purposes, we may establish reserves from offering proceeds, out of cash flow from operations or net cash proceeds from
the sale of properties. In addition, the terms of our mortgage loans payable require us to deposit certain replacement and other
reserves with the lender.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">In addition to making investments in accordance with our investment
objectives, we expect to use our capital resources to make certain payments to our Advisor and our dealer manager. During our organization
and offering stage, these payments will include payments to the dealer manager for selling commissions and dealer manager fee.
During this stage, we also will make payments to our Advisor for reimbursement of certain other organization and offering expenses.
However, we will not reimburse our Advisor (except in limited circumstances) for other organization and offering expenses to the
extent that our total payments for other organization and offering expenses would exceed 2% of the total offering price paid by
investors in our IPO. During our acquisition and development stage, we expect to make payments to our Advisor in connection with
the selection and origination or purchase of investments and the management of our assets and to reimburse certain costs incurred
by our Advisor in providing services to us. The advisory agreement has a one-year term but may be renewed for an unlimited number
of successive one-year periods upon the mutual consent of our Advisor and our independent directors.</P>

are required to make aggregate annual distributions to our stockholders of at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which does
not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP) determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and
excluding any net capital gain. We expect that our board of directors will continue to authorize distributions in excess of those
required for us to maintain REIT status depending on our financial condition and such other factors as our board of directors deems
relevant. We expect to continue paying distributions monthly unless our results of operations, our general financial condition,
general economic conditions or other factors make it imprudent to do so. The timing and amount of distributions will be determined
by our board and will be influenced in part by its intention to comply with REIT requirements of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,
as amended (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;). We have not established a minimum distribution level.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">All costs related to the improvement or replacement of real estate
properties are capitalized. Additions, renovations and improvements that enhance and/or extend the useful life of a property are
also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance, repairs and improvements that do not materially prolong the normal useful
life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred. We expense transaction costs associated with business combinations in the
period incurred.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Upon the acquisition of real estate properties, the fair value of
the real estate purchased is allocated to the acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements), and acquired
intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases). Acquired lease
intangible assets include above-market leases and acquired in-place leases in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The
fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value
is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on our determination of the relative fair values of these assets. In
valuing an acquired property&rsquo;s intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during
the expected lease-up periods, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on its evaluation
of current market demand. We also estimate costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions, tenant improvements,
legal and other related costs. Leasing commissions, legal and other related costs (&ldquo;lease origination costs&rdquo;) are classified
as deferred charges in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The value of in-place leases is measured by the excess of (i) the
purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates, over (ii) the estimated fair
value of the property as if vacant. Above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the present value (using a
discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between the contractual amounts to
be received and management&rsquo;s estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the respective leases that we deemed
appropriate at the time of acquisition. Such valuations include a consideration of the non-cancellable terms of the respective
leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values associated with below-market rental renewal options are determined
based on our experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The value of the
above-market and below-market leases associated with the original lease term is amortized to rental income and recorded as either
an increase (in the case of below-market leases) or decrease (in the case of above-market leases), over the terms of the respective
leases. The values of in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases.
If a lease were to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized
in operations at that time. We may record a bargain purchase gain if we determine that the purchase price for the acquired assets
was less than the fair value. We will record a liability in situations where any part of the cash consideration is deferred. The
amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value. The liability is subsequently re-measured to fair value with
changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of operations. If, up to one year from the acquisition date, information
regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate property adjustments
are made to the purchase price allocation on a retrospective basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">We review long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to aggregate future net cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment
to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value. We do not believe
that the value of any of our real estate investments was impaired at December 31, 2013.</P>

of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability of the related receivable.
In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year. These estimates have a direct impact on its net income
because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income. The provision for doubtful accounts at December&nbsp;31, 2013 and

of real estate companies, as discussed below, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (&ldquo;NAREIT&rdquo;),

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">We define FFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistently
with the standards established by the White Paper on FFO approved by the Board of Governors of NAREIT, as revised in February 2004
(the &ldquo;White Paper&rdquo;). The White Paper defines FFO as net income or loss computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding
gains or losses from sales of property and asset impairment write-downs, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments
for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. Adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated
to reflect FFO. Our FFO calculation complies with NAREIT&rsquo;s policy described above.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">The historical accounting convention used for
real estate assets requires depreciation of buildings and improvements, which implies that the value of real estate assets diminishes
predictably over time, especially if such assets are not adequately maintained or repaired and renovated as required by relevant
circumstances or as requested or required by lessees for operational purposes in order to maintain the value disclosed. We believe
that, since real estate values historically rise and fall with market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, the business
cycle, unemployment and consumer spending, presentations of operating results for a REIT using historical accounting for depreciation
may be less informative. Additionally, we believe it is appropriate to disregard impairment charges, as this is a fair value adjustment
that is largely based on market fluctuations and assessments regarding general market conditions which can change over time. An
asset will only be evaluated for impairment if certain impairment indicators exist and if the carrying, or book, value exceeds
the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows (including net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds on the sale of the property,
and any other ancillary cash flows at a property or group level under GAAP) from such asset. Investors should note, however, that
determinations of whether impairment charges have been incurred are based partly on anticipated operating performance, because
estimated undiscounted future cash flows from a property, including estimated future net rental and lease revenues, net proceeds
on the sale of the property, and certain other ancillary cash flows, are taken into account in determining whether an impairment
charge has been incurred. If the carrying, or book, value exceeds the total estimated undiscounted future cash flows, an impairment
charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. While impairment charges are excluded from the calculation of
FFO as described above, investors are cautioned that due to the fact that impairments are based on estimated undiscounted future
cash flows and the relatively limited term of our operations, it could be difficult to recover any impairment charges.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Historical accounting for real estate involves
the use of GAAP. Any other method of accounting for real estate such as the fair value method cannot be construed to be any more
accurate or relevant than the comparable methodologies of real estate valuation found in GAAP. Nevertheless, we believe that the
use of FFO, which excludes the impact of real estate related depreciation and amortization and impairments, provides a more complete
understanding of our performance to investors and to management, and when compared year over year, reflects the impact on our operations
from trends in occupancy rates, rental rates, operating costs, general and administrative expenses, and interest costs, which may
not be immediately apparent from net income. However, FFO and modified funds from operations (&ldquo;MFFO&rdquo;), as described
below, should not be construed to be more relevant or accurate than the current GAAP methodology in calculating net income or in
its applicability in evaluating our operating performance. The method utilized to evaluate the value and performance of real estate
under GAAP should be construed as a more relevant measure of operational performance and considered more prominently than the non-GAAP
FFO and MFFO measures and the adjustments to GAAP in calculating FFO and MFFO.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Changes in the accounting and reporting promulgations
under GAAP (for acquisition fees and expenses from a capitalization/depreciation model to an expensed-as-incurred model) that were
put into effect in 2009 and other changes to GAAP accounting for real estate subsequent to the establishment of NAREIT&rsquo;s
definition of FFO have prompted an increase in cash-settled expenses, specifically acquisition fees and expenses for all industries
as items that are expensed under GAAP, that are typically accounted for as operating expenses. Management believes these fees and
expenses do not affect our overall long-term operating performance. Publicly registered, non-listed REITs typically have a significant
amount of acquisition activity and are substantially more dynamic during their initial years of investment and operation. As disclosed
elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have used, and will continue to use the proceeds raised in our IPO to acquire
properties, and we intend to begin the process of achieving a liquidity event (i.e., listing of our Common Shares on a national
exchange, a merger or sale of the company or another similar transaction) within six to nine years of the completion of our IPO.
Thus, we will not continuously purchase assets and have a targeted exit strategy. Due to the above factors and other unique features
of publicly registered, non-listed REITs, the IPA has standardized a measure known as MFFO, which the IPA has recommended as a
supplemental measure for publicly registered non-listed REITs and which we believe to be another appropriate supplemental measure
to reflect the operating performance of a non-listed REIT having the characteristics described above. MFFO is not equivalent to
our net income or loss as determined under GAAP, and MFFO may not be a useful measure of the impact of long-term operating performance
on value if we do not continue to operate with a targeted exit strategy, as currently intended. We believe that, because MFFO excludes
costs that we consider more reflective of investing activities and other non-operating items included in FFO and also excludes
acquisition fees and expenses that affect our operations only in periods in which properties are acquired, MFFO can provide, on
a going forward basis, an indication of the sustainability (that is, the capacity to continue to be maintained) of our operating
performance after the period in which we are acquiring our properties and once our portfolio is stabilized. By providing MFFO,
we believe we are presenting useful information that assists investors and analysts to better assess the sustainability of our
operating performance after our IPO has been completed and our portfolio has been stabilized. We also believe that MFFO is a recognized
measure of sustainable operating performance by the non-listed REIT industry. Further, we believe MFFO is useful in comparing the
sustainability of our operating performance after our IPO and acquisitions are completed with the sustainability of the operating
performance of other real estate companies that are not as involved in acquisition activities. Investors are cautioned that MFFO
should only be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance after our IPO has been completed and properties have
been acquired, as it excludes acquisition costs that have a negative effect on our operating performance during the periods in
which properties are acquired.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">We define MFFO, a non-GAAP measure, consistently
with the IPA&rsquo;s Guideline 2010-01, Supplemental Performance Measure for Publicly Registered, Non-Listed REITs: Modified Funds
from Operations, issued by the IPA in November 2010 (the &ldquo;Practice Guideline&rdquo;). The Practice Guideline defines MFFO
as FFO further adjusted for the following items, as applicable, included in the determination of GAAP net income: acquisition fees
and expenses; amounts relating to deferred rent receivables and amortization of above and below market leases and liabilities (which
are adjusted in order to reflect such payments from a GAAP accrual basis to a cash basis of disclosing the rent and lease payments);
accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums on debt investments; mark-to-market adjustments included in net income; gains
or losses included in net income from the extinguishment or sale of debt, hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings
where trading of such holdings is not a fundamental attribute of the business plan, unrealized gains or losses resulting from consolidation
from, or deconsolidation to, equity accounting, and after adjustments for consolidated and unconsolidated partnerships and joint
ventures, with such adjustments calculated to reflect MFFO on the same basis. The accretion of discounts and amortization of premiums
on debt investments, unrealized gains and losses on hedges, foreign exchange, derivatives or securities holdings, unrealized gains
and losses resulting from consolidations, as well as other listed cash flow adjustments are adjustments made to net income in calculating
the cash flows provided by operating activities and, in some cases, reflect gains or losses which are unrealized and may not ultimately
be realized. While we are responsible for managing interest rate, hedge and foreign exchange risk, we do retain an outside consultant
to review all our hedging agreements. In as much as interest rate hedges are not a fundamental part of our operations, we believe
it is appropriate to exclude such gains and losses in calculating MFFO, as such gains and losses are not reflective of ongoing
operations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">Our MFFO calculation complies with the Practice
Guideline. In calculating MFFO, we exclude acquisition related expenses, amortization of above and below market leases, fair value
adjustments of derivative financial instruments, deferred rent receivables and the adjustments of such items related to noncontrolling
interests. Under GAAP, acquisition fees and expenses are characterized as operating expenses in determining operating net income.
These expenses are paid in cash by us, and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors. All paid and
accrued acquisition fees and expenses negatively impact our operating performance during the period in which properties are acquired
and will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us,
unless earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of other properties are generated to cover the purchase
price of the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to such property. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate
indicator of our operating performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. MFFO that excludes such
costs and expenses would only be comparable to that of non-listed REITs that have completed their acquisition activities and have
similar operating characteristics as us. Further, under GAAP, certain contemplated non-cash fair value and other non-cash adjustments
are considered operating non-cash adjustments to net income in determining cash flow from operating activities. In addition, we
view fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are unrealized and may not ultimately be realized. We view both gains
and losses from dispositions of assets and fair value adjustments of derivatives as items which are not reflective of ongoing operations
and are therefore typically adjusted for when assessing operating performance. As disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on
Form 10-K, the purchase of properties, and the corresponding expenses associated with that process, is a key operational feature
of our business plan to generate operational income and cash flows in order to make distributions to investors. Acquisition fees
and expenses will not be reimbursed by our Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of Common Shares in our IPO,
and therefore such fees and expenses will need to be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net
proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary cash flows.</P>

to calculate it in order to evaluate our performance against other non-listed REITs. We believe that our use of MFFO and the adjustments
used to calculate it allow us to present our performance in a manner that reflects certain characteristics that are unique to non-listed
REITs, such as a limited and defined acquisition period. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, the use of MFFO provides information
consistent with management&rsquo;s analysis of the operating performance of the properties. Additionally, fair value adjustments,
which are based on the impact of current market fluctuations and underlying assessments of general market conditions, but can also
result from operational factors such as rental and occupancy rates, may not be directly related or attributable to our current
operating performance. By excluding such changes that may reflect anticipated and unrealized gains or losses, we believe MFFO provides
useful supplemental information.</P>

provide useful information to investors as they compare the operating performance of different REITs, although it should be noted
that not all REITs calculate FFO and MFFO the same way. Accordingly, comparisons with other REITs may not be meaningful. Furthermore,
FFO and MFFO are not necessarily indicative of cash flow available to fund cash needs and should not be considered as an alternative
to net income (loss) or income (loss) from continuing operations as an indication of our performance, as an alternative to cash
flows from operations as an indication of our liquidity, or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs including our
ability to make distributions to our stockholders. FFO and MFFO should be reviewed in conjunction with GAAP measurements as an
indication of our performance. MFFO has limitations as a performance measure in an offering such as ours where the price of a Common
Share in the primary offering is a stated value and there is, with respect to the primary offering, no net asset value determination.
MFFO is useful in assisting management and investors in assessing the sustainability of operating performance in future operating
periods, and in particular, after the offering and acquisition stages are complete and net asset value is disclosed. FFO and MFFO
are not useful measures in evaluating net asset value because impairments are taken into account in determining net asset value
but not in determining FFO or MFFO.</P>

would have to adjust our calculation and characterization of FFO or MFFO.</P>

operating characteristics. By excluding expensed acquisition costs, management believes MFFO provides useful supplemental information
that is comparable for each type of real estate investment and is consistent with management&rsquo;s analysis of the investing
and operating performance of our properties. Acquisition fees and expenses include payments to our Advisor or third parties. Acquisition
fees and expenses under GAAP are considered operating expenses and as expenses included in the determination of net income and
income from continuing operations, both of which are performance measures under GAAP. Such fees and expenses are paid in cash,
and therefore such funds will not be available to distribute to investors. Such fees and expenses negatively impact our operating
performance during the period in which properties are being acquired. Therefore, MFFO may not be an accurate indicator of our operating
performance, especially during periods in which properties are being acquired. All paid and accrued acquisition fees and expenses
will have negative effects on returns to investors, the potential for future distributions, and cash flows generated by us, unless
earnings from operations or net sales proceeds from the disposition of properties are generated to cover the purchase price of
the property, these fees and expenses and other costs related to the property. Acquisition fees and expenses will not be reimbursed
by our Advisor if there are no further proceeds from the sale of Common Shares in our IPO, and therefore such fees will need to
be paid from either additional debt, operational earnings or cash flows, net proceeds from the sale of properties or from ancillary
cash flows.</TD></TR></TABLE>

the Code and intend to operate as such beginning with our taxable year ended December 31, 2013. We expect to have little or no
taxable income prior to electing REIT status. In order to qualify as a REIT, we must meet certain organizational and operational
requirements, including a requirement to distribute annually to our stockholders at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (which
does not equal net income, as calculated in accordance with GAAP), determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid
and excluding any net capital gain. As a REIT, we generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our
taxable income or capital gain which is distributed to our stockholders. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT
in any subsequent year after electing REIT status and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions, our income for that
year will be taxed at regular corporate rates, and we may be precluded from qualifying for treatment as a REIT for the four-year
period following our failure to qualify as a REIT. Such an event could materially adversely affect our net income and net cash
available for distribution to stockholders. However, we intend to organize and operate in such a manner as to qualify for treatment
as a REIT.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">The market risk associated with financial
instruments and derivative financial instruments is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices or interest rates. Our
long-term debt, which consists of secured financings, bears interest at&nbsp;fixed rates. Our interest rate risk management objectives
are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs. From time
to time, we may enter into interest rate hedge contracts such as swaps, collars, and treasury lock agreements in order to mitigate
our interest rate risk with respect to various debt instruments. We would not hold or issue these derivative contracts for trading
or speculative purposes. We do not have any foreign operations and thus we are not exposed to foreign currency fluctuations.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">As of December&nbsp;31, 2013, our debt
consisted of fixed-rate secured mortgage loans payable, with a carrying value of $15.9 million, which approximated the fair value
at December 31, 2013. Changes in market interest rates on our fixed-rate debt impact the fair value of the loans, but have no impact
on interest incurred or cash flow. For instance, if interest rates rise 100 basis points and our fixed-rate debt balance remains
constant, we expect the fair value of our obligation to decrease, the same way the price of a bond declines as interest rates rise.
The sensitivity analysis related to our fixed&ndash;rate debt assumes an immediate 100 basis point move in interest rates from
their December&nbsp;31, 2013 levels, with all other variables held constant.&nbsp; A 100 basis point increase in market interest
rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $628,350. A 100 basis point decrease in market interest
rates would result in an increase in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt by $581,721.&nbsp; These amounts were determined by
considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates changes on our borrowing costs, and assuming no other changes in our capital
structure.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of
United Realty Trust Incorporated (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements
of operations, equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included
the financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedules based on our audits.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. We were not engaged to perform an
audit of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over
financial reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose
of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company&rsquo;s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we
express no such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating
the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of United Realty Trust Incorporated at December 31, 2013
and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December
31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedules, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, present fairly in all material respects
the information set forth therein.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">United Realty Trust Incorporated (the &rsquo;&lsquo;Company&rsquo;&rsquo;)
was formed on November 8, 2011 as a Maryland corporation and intends to qualify as a real estate investment trust (&rsquo;&lsquo;REIT&rsquo;&rsquo;)
for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, the Company inadvertently filed a U.S. federal income tax return for the tax year
ending December 31, 2011 on Internal Revenue Service (&ldquo;IRS&rdquo;), Form 1120-REIT, which may be treated as having made its
REIT election commencing with that tax year. The Company intends to file for relief with the IRS so that it will not be treated
as having made its REIT election prior to the tax year ending December 31, 2013. It is solely within the discretion of the IRS
to grant the relief sought. If the Company is unable to obtain the relief it seeks from the IRS, generally the Company would be
unable to make its REIT election until the fifth taxable year after the year in which it failed to qualify as a REIT. Substantially
all of the Company&rsquo;s business is conducted through United Realty Capital Operating Partnership, L.P. (the &rsquo;&lsquo;Operating
Partnership&rsquo;&rsquo;), a Delaware limited partnership formed on November 8, 2011. The Company is the general partner of the
Operating Partnership and holds both general and limited partnership interests in the Operating Partnership. As the Company completes
the settlement for the purchase orders for shares of the Company&rsquo;s common stock, par value $0.01 per share (&rsquo;&lsquo;Common
Shares&rsquo;&rsquo;) in its continuous public offering, it will transfer substantially all of the net proceeds of the offering
to the Operating Partnership.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">At December 31, 2013, the Company owned
a 98.7% economic interest in the Operating Partnership. The limited partners&rsquo; interest in the Operating Partnership
(1.3% at December 31, 2013) is represented by Operating Partnership Units (&ldquo;OP Units&rdquo;). The carrying amount of
such interest is adjusted at the end of each reporting period to an amount equal to the limited partners&rsquo;
ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership&rsquo;s net equity. The approximately 673,727 OP Units and 9,091
LP units outstanding at December 31, 2013 are economically equivalent to the Company&rsquo;s Common Stock.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">The Company was organized to invest in a diversified
portfolio of income-producing commercial real estate properties and other real estate-related assets. On November 25, 2011, United
Realty Advisor Holdings LLC, a Delaware limited liability Company (the &ldquo;Sponsor&rdquo;) purchased 500,000 shares of preferred
stock for $50,000.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">The Company is offering to the public 100,000,000
Common Shares in its primary offering and 20,000,000 Common Shares pursuant to its distribution reinvestment program (&rsquo;&lsquo;DRIP&rsquo;&rsquo;).
The Company may reallocate the Common Shares offered between the primary offering and the DRIP. The Company expects to sell the
Common Shares offered in the primary offering until August 15, 2015.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">The Company intends to invest primarily in
interests in real estate located in the United States, with a primary focus on the eastern United States and in markets that the
Company believes are likely to benefit from favorable demographic changes, or that the Company believes are poised for strong economic
growth. The Company may invest in interests in a wide variety of commercial property types, including office, industrial, retail
and hospitality properties, single-tenant properties, multifamily properties, age-restricted residences, and in other real estate-related
assets. The Company may acquire assets directly or through joint ventures, by making an equity investment in a project or by making
a mezzanine or bridge loan with a right to acquire equity in the project. The Company also may buy debt secured by an asset with
a view toward acquiring the asset through foreclosure. The Company also may originate or invest in mortgages, bridge or mezzanine
loans and tenant-in-common interests, or entities that make investments similar to the foregoing. Further, the Company may invest
in real estate-related securities, including securities issued by other real estate companies.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">The accompanying consolidated financial statements
are prepared on the accrual basis in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (&ldquo;GAAP&rdquo;). The consolidated
financial statements include the accounts and those of its subsidiaries, which are wholly-owned or controlled by the Company. Entities
which the Company does not control through its voting interest and entities which are variable interest entities (&ldquo;VIEs&rdquo;),
but where it is not the primary beneficiary, are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">The Company follows the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (&ldquo;FASB&rdquo;) guidance for determining whether an entity is a VIE and requires the performance of a qualitative
rather than a quantitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of a VIE.&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this guidance, an entity would
be required to consolidate a VIE if it has (i) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&rsquo;s
economic performance and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could
be significant to the VIE. Included in Real estate investments on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31,
2013 and December 31, 2012 are approximately $2.0 million and $0, respectively, related to the Company&rsquo;s&nbsp;consolidated VIE&rsquo;s.
Included in Mortgage notes payable on the Company&rsquo;s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012 are
approximately $1.5 million and $0, respectively, related to the Company&rsquo;s consolidated VIE&rsquo;s</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left"><B>&nbsp;</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">A non-controlling interest in a consolidated subsidiary is defined
as the portion of the equity (net assets) in a subsidiary not attributable, directly or indirectly, to a parent. Non-controlling
interests are required to be presented as a separate component of equity in the consolidated balance sheet. This guidance modifies
the presentation of net income by requiring earnings and other comprehensive income to be attributed to controlling and non-controlling
interests.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Company assesses the accounting treatment for each joint venture.
This assessment includes a review of each joint venture or limited liability company agreement to determine which party has what
rights and whether those rights are protective or participating. For all VIEs, the Company reviews such agreements in order to
determine which party has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the entity&rsquo;s economic performance.
In situations where the Company or its partner approves, among other things, the annual budget, receives a detailed monthly reporting
package from the Company, meets on a quarterly basis to review the results of the joint venture, reviews and approves the joint
venture&rsquo;s tax return before filing, and approves all leases that cover more than a nominal amount of space relative to the
total rentable space at each property, the Company does not consolidate the joint venture as it considers these to be substantive
participation rights that result in shared power of the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the joint
venture. At December 31, 2013 the Company deemed its investment in 14 Highland to be VIE since it has an economic interest greater
than its voting proportion, and the Company participates in the management activities that significantly impact the performance
of the joint venture.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP
requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, the reported
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during
the periods covered by the financial statements. Actual results could differ from these estimates.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The Company measures the fair value of financial instruments based
on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. As a basis for considering market participant
assumptions in fair value measurements, a fair value hierarchy distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market
data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity and the reporting entity&rsquo;s own assumptions about market participant
assumptions. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy, Level 1 assets/liabilities are valued based on quoted prices for identical
instruments in active markets, Level 2 assets/liabilities are valued based on quoted prices in active markets for similar instruments,
on quoted prices in less active or inactive markets, or on other &ldquo;observable&rdquo; market inputs and Level 3 assets/liabilities
are valued based significantly on &ldquo;unobservable&rdquo; market inputs.</P>

for cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, prepaid expenses, deposit on real estate, tenant and other receivables, accounts
payable, dividends payable, tenant security deposits, and due&nbsp;from affiliates approximate their fair values based on their

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">All costs related to the improvement or replacement of real estate
properties are capitalized. Additions, renovations and improvements that enhance and/or extend the useful life of a property are
also capitalized. Expenditures for ordinary maintenance, repairs and improvements that do not materially prolong the normal useful
life of an asset are charged to operations as incurred. The Company expenses transaction costs associated with business combinations
in the period incurred.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">Upon the acquisition of real estate properties, the fair value of
the real estate purchased is allocated to the acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements), and acquired
intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases). Acquired lease
intangible assets include above-market leases and acquired in-place leases in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The
fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value
is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on management&rsquo;s determination of the relative fair values of
these assets. In valuing an acquired property&rsquo;s intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying
costs during the expected lease-up periods, and estimates of lost rental revenue during the expected lease-up periods based on
its evaluation of current market demand. Management also estimates costs to execute similar leases, including leasing commissions,
tenant improvements, legal and other related costs. Leasing commissions, legal and other related costs (&ldquo;lease origination
costs&rdquo;) are classified as deferred charges in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0">The value of in-place leases is measured by the excess of (i)
the purchase price paid for a property after adjusting existing in-place leases to market rental rates, over (ii) the
estimated fair value of the property as if vacant. Above-market and below-market lease values are recorded based on the
present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired) of the difference between
the contractual amounts to be received and management&rsquo;s estimate of market lease rates, measured over the terms of the
respective leases that management deemed appropriate at the time of acquisition. Such valuations include a consideration of
the non-cancellable terms of the respective leases as well as any applicable renewal periods. The fair values associated with
below-market rental renewal options are determined based on the Company&rsquo;s experience and the relevant facts and
circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions. The value of the above-market and below-market leases associated
with the original lease term is amortized to rental income and recorded as either an increase (in the case of below market
leases) or decrease (in the case of above market leases), over the terms of the respective leases and option periods. The values of
in-place leases are amortized to expense over the remaining non-cancellable terms of the respective leases. If a lease were
to be terminated prior to its stated expiration, all unamortized amounts relating to that lease would be recognized in
operations at that time. The Company may record a bargain purchase gain if it determines that the purchase price for the
acquired assets was less than the fair value. The Company will record a liability in situations where any part of the cash
consideration is deferred. The amounts payable in the future are discounted to their present value. The liability is
subsequently re-measured to fair value with changes in fair value recognized in the consolidated statements of
operations. If, up to one year from the acquisition date, information regarding fair value of assets acquired and liabilities
assumed is received and estimates are refined, appropriate property adjustments are made to the purchase price allocation on
a retrospective basis.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: left">The Company reviews long-lived assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability
of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to aggregate future net cash flows
(undiscounted and without interest) expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered impaired, the impairment
to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed the fair value. Management does not
believe that the value of any of the Company&rsquo;s real estate investments was impaired at December 31, 2013.</P>

rental abatements and contractual fixed increases attributable to operating leases, on a straight-line basis over the term of the
related lease and will include amounts expected to be received in later years in deferred rents. The Company will record property
operating expense reimbursements due from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate taxes and other recoverable costs in
the period the related expenses are incurred. The Company will make certain assumptions and judgments in estimating the reimbursements
at the end of each reporting period. The Company does not expect the actual results to differ from the estimated reimbursement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">The Company makes estimates of the collectability
of its tenant receivables related to base rents, expense reimbursements and other revenue or income. The Company will specifically
analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts, customer creditworthiness, current economic trends and changes in customer
payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts. In addition, with respect to tenants in bankruptcy,
the Company will make estimates of the expected recovery of pre-petition and post-petition claims in assessing the estimated collectability
of the related receivable. In some cases, the ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year. These estimates have a direct
impact on its net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income. The provision for doubtful accounts at December&nbsp;31,
2013 and December 31, 2012 was approximately $608,000 and $0, respectively.</P>

(i) $14.5 million with a new first mortgage secured by Tilden House; (ii) $7.5 million by the seller contributing some of its
equity in Tilden House to the JV; and (iii) cash from the Company&rsquo;s ongoing public offering in an amount which, when combined

by the Lender to the Borrower and is secured by properties located at 58 and 70 Parker Avenue, Poughkeepsie, New York (together,
the &ldquo;Property&rdquo;). The Advisor assigned its interest in Note LLC to the Operating Partnership in satisfaction of a $1.15

of Note LLC to the Lender that existed as of March 29, 2013. In addition, Summer has agreed to advance all litigation expenses
associated with prosecuting the existing foreclosure action initiated by Note LLC with respect to the Loan (as further described

million to the Operating Partnership. If, after the collection of all the sums due Note LLC under the Loan (whether by payment
from the Borrower, by sale of the Loan or, after the vesting of title to the Property in Note Holdings or in Note LLC as a result
of foreclosure, by sale of the Property) and the distribution thereof by Note Holdings to the members, the Operating Partnership
has not received aggregate distributions of at least $1.15 million, Summer will pay to Note Holdings the difference between $1.15

to issue 200,000,000 Common Shares and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock. All shares of such stock have a par value of $0.01
per share. On November 17, 2011, the Sponsor purchased 18,182 Common Shares for total cash consideration of $200,000 to provide
the Company&rsquo;s initial capitalization. On November 25, 2011, for $50,000, the Sponsor purchased 500,000 shares of preferred
stock, subsequently exchanged for 500,000 sponsor preferred shares (&rsquo;&rsquo;Sponsor Preferred Shares&rsquo;&rsquo;), which
are convertible into Common Shares upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Company&rsquo;s charter, and which
have a preference upon the Company&rsquo;s liquidation, dissolution or winding up as described below. Upon the Company&rsquo;s
liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the Sponsor will receive a preference in the amount of 15% of any excess of the net sales
proceeds from the sale of all the assets in connection with such liquidation, dissolution or winding up over the amount of Invested
Capital, as defined in the Company&rsquo;s charter, plus a cumulative non-compounded pre-tax annual return to holders of Common
Shares of 7% on Invested Capital. The Company&rsquo;s board of directors is authorized to amend its charter from time to time,
without the approval of the stockholders, to increase or decrease the aggregate number of authorized shares of capital stock or
the number of shares of any class or series that the Company has authority to issue.</P>

May 9, 2013, provides for the grant of equity incentive awards to the Company&rsquo;s independent directors, officers and employees,
employees of the Advisor and other affiliates and consultants. The aggregate number of Common Shares that may be issued or used
for reference purposes or with respect to which awards may be granted under the Plan shall not exceed the lesser of five percent
(5%) of Common Shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis at any time and 5,000,000 Common Shares, which may be either authorized
and unissued Common Shares or Common Shares held in or acquired for the treasury of the Company or both. The vesting period of
stock-based awards will be determined by the Company&rsquo;s compensation committee. During the year ended December 31, 2013, the
Company granted 18,274 Common Shares under the Plan of which 8,800 were fully vested on the date of grant and the remainder will
vest over 15 months effective April 1, 2013. Nothing was granted during the year ended December 31, 2012. The 8,800 shares were
granted to employees of the Company, employees of an affiliate of the Company and to an independent consultant for services provided
to the Company and 9,474 shares were granted to the independent directors of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2013
the Company expensed $54,000, related to the amortization of the independent directors&rsquo; restricted stock. As of December&nbsp;31,
2013, there remained a total of $36,000 of unrecognized restricted stock compensation related to outstanding non-vested restricted
stock grants awarded in 2013. Restricted stock compensation is expected to be expensed in the first quarter of 2014.</P>

a result of an award against Allied Beacon in an arbitration before FINRA in the amount of approximately $1.6 million, wholly unrelated
to the Company or to Allied Beacon&rsquo;s role as dealer manager for the IPO, Allied Beacon would not be able to meet its net
capital requirement. On May 30, 2013 the IPO was suspended as a result thereof.</P>
