<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in; border: white 1pt solid">On

its proxy statement (&ldquo;Proxy Statement&rdquo;) describing the matters to be voted upon at the Company&rsquo;s 2015 Annual
Meeting (the &ldquo;Annual Meeting&rdquo;) of Stockholders to be held on Wednesday, June 17, 2015 at the Company&rsquo;s offices,
located at 60 Broad Street 34th Floor, New York, New York 10004, commencing at 12:00 p.m. (local time). The Proxy Statement, and
the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting, were dated as of April 30, 2015. The Proxy Statement stated that the Proxy Statement,
the accompanying proxy card, the Notice of Annual Meeting and the Company&rsquo;s 2014 Annual Report were first mailed to the Company&rsquo;s
stockholders on or about April 30, 2015. In fact, the Proxy Statement, the accompanying proxy card, the Notice of Annual Meeting
and the Company&rsquo;s 2014 Annual Report were first mailed to the Company&rsquo;s stockholders on May 15, 2015.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">This supplement
(this &ldquo;Supplement&rdquo;) updates the Proxy Statement to reflect the correct mailing date and other information related thereto.
This Supplement also (i) corrects the information about what vote is required to elect directors to state that directors will be
elected by a majority of all votes cast at the Annual Meeting rather than a plurality of all votes cast at the Annual Meeting;
(ii) adds additional information about a former executive officer and director of the Company; and (iii) updates the disclosure
concerning related party transactions to include amounts through March 31, 2015 and for other updates.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 8pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">This Supplement
updates the Proxy Statement and should be read in conjunction with it and is first being mailed to stockholders on or about
June 1, 2015. This Supplement does not change the proposals to be acted on at the Annual Meeting or the recommendations of the
Company&rsquo;s board of directors in relation thereto, which are described in the Proxy Statement. Except as specifically
supplemented by the information contained in this Supplement, all information set forth in the Proxy Statement continues to
apply and should be considered in voting your shares. Any term used herein and not otherwise defined herein shall have the
meaning set forth in the Proxy Statement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">A majority of the
votes cast at a meeting of stockholders duly called and at which a quorum is present will be sufficient to elect the directors
named in this Proxy Statement, ratify the appointment of Ernst &amp; Young LLP and approve any other proposals that may be made.
Any Common Shares not voted (whether by abstention, broker non-vote, or otherwise) have no impact on the vote. A &ldquo;broker
non-vote&rdquo; occurs when a broker who holds Common Shares for the beneficial owner does not vote on a proposal because the broker
does not have discretionary voting authority for that proposal and has not received instructions from the beneficial owner of Common
Shares.</P>

annual meeting, we must receive written notice of the proposal at our executive offices no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time,

equal to 15% of any net cash flows in respect of each calendar year remaining after payment to holders of Common Shares of distributions
(including from sources other than operating cash flow) for such calendar year, such that the holders of Common Shares have received
a 7% pre-tax, non-compounded annual return on the capital contributed by holders of Common Shares. &ldquo;Net cash flows&rdquo;
means, for any period, the excess of: (i) the sum of (A) our revenues for such period, as determined under GAAP, from ownership
and/or operation of properties, loans and other investments and (B) the net cash proceeds we realize during such period from any
sales of assets; over (ii) the sum of all costs and expenses paid or incurred by us, as determined under GAAP, that are in any
way related to our operation or to corporate business, including advisory fees, the expenses of raising capital such as organization
and offering expenses, legal, audit, accounting, underwriting, brokerage, listing, registration and other fees, printing and other
such expenses and taxes incurred in connection with the issuance, distribution, transfer, registration and listing of our Common
Shares, interest payments, taxes, non-cash expenditures such as depreciation, amortization and bad debt reserves, incentive fees
paid in compliance with the NASAA REIT Guidelines, acquisition fees and acquisition expenses, real estate commissions on the sale
of property and other fees and expenses connected with the acquisition, disposition, management and ownership of real estate interests,
mortgage loans or other property (including the costs of foreclosure, insurance premiums, legal services, maintenance, repair
and improvement of property). Our use of &ldquo;net cash flow&rdquo;, a non-GAAP measure, as a metric instead of GAAP net income
likely will result in the payment of a higher amount to the Advisor than if the Advisor were to receive, annually, an amount equal
to 15% of GAAP net income after payment of such 7% annual return. We cannot assure you that we will provide such 7% annual return,
which we have disclosed solely as a measure for the Advisor&rsquo;s incentive compensation. Because such 7% annual return may
consist in part of distributions from sources other than operating cash flow, the source of such 7% annual return may not be entirely
from net income; to the extent that the source of such 7% annual return is not from net income, then the value of your Common
Shares may be impacted negatively. Our Advisor may have an incentive to increase the amount of distributions from sources other
than operating cash flow in order to maximize its subordinated share of annual cash flows. Our Advisor may receive a subordinated
share of annual cash flows even if distributions to holders of Common Shares have exceeded our cash flows from operations.&nbsp;</P></TD>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On December 16,
2014, to fund a portion of the cost of the acquisition of an office building located at 7 Carnegie Plaza, Cherry Hill, NJ (&ldquo;7
Carnegie&rdquo;), through a special purpose entity (the &ldquo;SPE&rdquo;), we borrowed a principal amount of $1.8 million under
a mezzanine loan (the &ldquo;Mezzanine Loan&rdquo;), from the unaffiliated third party selling 7 Carnegie (the &ldquo;Seller&rdquo;).
The Mezzanine Loan bore interest at an initial rate of 6% per annum, which would have increased to a rate of 8% per annum on March
31, 2015. Interest would have accrued but would not have been payable until January 6, 2020, when all principal and accrued interest
would have become due and payable. The Mezzanine Loan was secured by a security interest in 7 Carnegie, guaranteed by us, and could
be accelerated only in the event of a default. We were able to prepay all or any portion of the principal amount under the Mezzanine
Loan without penalty. Pursuant to a side letter (the &ldquo;December Side Letter&rdquo;) entered into in connection with the Mezzanine
Loan between and among the Seller, the SPE and W.A. Lloyd, LLC (&ldquo;WAL&rdquo;), a limited liability company controlled by Jacob
Frydman, our chairman and chief executive officer, if the SPE did not prepay the principal amount of the Mezzanine Loan by February
28, 2015, the Seller would have been entitled to excess cash flow under the first mortgage loan from UBS Real Estate Securities,
Inc. on 7 Carnegie and WAL would have been required to contribute, as additional collateral for the Mezzanine Loan, a separate
property (the &ldquo;WAL Property&rdquo;) that is unconnected to 7 Carnegie, located in New York and owned and controlled by WAL.
On March 25, 2015, pursuant to a letter agreement between and among the Seller, the SPE and WAL, we repaid the Mezzanine Loan,
and the obligations of the parties under the December Side Letter were satisfied, by providing the Seller the following consideration:
(i) $1.0 million in cash; (ii) execution of a new promissory note (the &ldquo;New Note&rdquo;) by the SPE in favor of the Seller
in the amount of $767,960 which bears interest at a rate of 6% per annum and matures on September 24, 2015; (iii) a guaranty (the
&ldquo;WAL Guaranty&rdquo;) of the obligations under the New Note by WAL; (iv) a mortgage by WAL of the WAL Property to secure
the WAL Guarantee; and (v) a release of a note given by an affiliate of the Seller in favor of us on February 4, 2015 in the amount
of $60,959.34. Through March 31, 2015, we had paid interest in the amount of $383.98 on the New Note.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In February 2015,
we had advanced $100,000 in cash (the &ldquo;Initial Deposit&rdquo;) to United Realty Funds Management, LLC (&ldquo;Funds Management&rdquo;),
an entity wholly owned and controlled by Jacob Frydman, our chairman and chief executive officer, to allow it to make a soft deposit
required by the purchase and sale agreement entered into on January 29, 2015 (the &ldquo;PSA&rdquo;) between Lippincott Real Estate
Associates, LLC (the &ldquo;Seller&rdquo;) and Funds Management pursuant to which Funds Management had the right to acquire the
property located at 402 and 404 Lippincott Drive, Marlton, NJ (the &ldquo;Lippincott Property&rdquo;) for $9.5 million. On March
4, 2015, Funds Management assigned its rights and obligations under the PSA to UR Lippincott, DST (&ldquo;Lippincott DST&rdquo;),
a Delaware statutory trust sponsored and controlled by Funds Management, such that Lippincott DST would pay $11.8 million for the
Lippincott Property. The $2.3 million difference between the purchase price for Funds Management and Lippincott DST represents
the $2.3 million fee for assigning Lippincott DST its rights and obligations under the PSA that Funds Management is entitled to
receive in connection with the transaction that has not yet been paid (the &ldquo;Assignment Fee&rdquo;). The full Assignment Fee
will become payable when all 100 units of beneficial interest in Lippincott DST (each such unit representing a 1% beneficial interest
in Lippincott DST, a &ldquo;Unit&rdquo;) are sold. The Units are being offered by the Dealer Manager to private investors for $73,000
per Unit, of which $6,570 may be payable to the Dealer Manager as sales commissions or expenses. To date, the Dealer Manager has
waived its right to receive any amounts under these selling arrangements, although it has continued to participate in the offering
of the Units, which remains open until July 14, 2015. When all 100 Units are sold, the total cost to Lippincott DST for the Lippincott
Property will be $13.8 million, representing the $10.5 million paid at closing, $2.3 million for the Assignment Fee and $1.0 million
on account of offering expenses, reserves and transaction fees due to various third parties.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On May 15, 2015,
Lippincott DST acquired the Lippincott Property, and we, through our operating partnership, entered into a Purchase Agreement with
Funds Management to purchase 5 Units in the Lippincott DST for $365,000, of which $100,000 was deemed to have been previously paid
through the advance of the Initial Deposit and $265,000 was paid in cash to Lippincott DST on May 15, 2015. As of May 28, 2015,
55 Units had been purchased by third-party investors and us and 45 Units had been purchased or are being held by Funds Management.
All but one of the Units purchased or held by Funds Management are still available for sale to additional third-party investors.
If any Units have not been sold by the close of the offering, Funds Management will either retain them or purchase them for its
own account and effectively fund the payment of the Assignment Fee to it with its own money. In any event, we have no further obligations
to purchase additional Units from Funds Management and do not intend to do so.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The total amount
paid in cash by Lippincott DST at the closing was $10.5 million, which was funded through a $6.5 million mortgage loan taken out
by Lippincott DST secured by the Lippincott Property and $4.0 million from the sale of Units to us, third-party investors and Funds
Management. This amount comprised of $9.5 million paid to the sellers of the Lippincott Property under the PSA and the balance
paid to various third parties to cover offering expenses, reserves and transaction fees.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">A holder of Units
is entitled to a proportionate share in distributions from the operations or sale of the Lippincott Property, after paying or reimbursing
Funds Management for any reasonable fees or expenses paid by Funds Management on behalf of Lippincott DST and reserving and retaining
such additional amounts as Funds Management determines are necessary to pay anticipated ordinary current and future Lippincott
DST expenses. Units are also subject to transfer restrictions and other restrictions on ownership. Holders of Units have no rights
to contribute additional assets, to vote or to otherwise direct in any manner the operations of Lippincott DST or the actions of
Funds Management, in it its capacity as manager of Lippincott DST. As manager under the trust agreement governing Lippincott DST,
Funds Management manages and directs the investment activities and affairs of Lippincott DST and, among other things, is authorized
and directed to take all actions required to ensure Lippincott DST&rsquo;s obligations under its indebtedness are met, rents on
the Lippincott Property are collected and that distributions are made to holders of Units. In this capacity, Funds Management has
no fiduciary duties whatsoever to Lippincott DST or to the holders of Units, and Funds Management is, among other things, also
entitled to receive reimbursement for its expenses in connection with its duties and, together with its officers, directors employees
and agents, to be indemnified by Lippincott DST and holders of Units against any losses arising out of the performance of its duties
as manager except for losses resulting from fraud or gross negligence. During the period that Lippincott DST has been in existence,
there have been no reimbursements of acquisition fees to Funds Management and no indemnification claims.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">The Lippincott Property
is a 53,100 square foot commercial building that is leased to a healthcare management service provider under a net lease agreement
which expires on December 31, 2024. The annual rent for 2015 is $1,088,550 and the rent is subject to annual increases of $0.50
per square foot per annum until the lease expiration.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">In addition, the
Property Manager will serve as the property manager of the Lippincott Property and will receive an annual fee equal to $24,000
per annum, pro-rated and paid monthly in arrears. In addition, the Property Manager will be reimbursed for its out-of-pocket expenses
not covered by gross income from the Lippincott Property. Through May 28, 2015, the Property Manager has not received any fees
or reimbursements pursuant to this arrangement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On May 19, 2015,
an undeveloped land parcel located on Route 9W, Ulster County, NY (&ldquo;Route 9W&rdquo;), consisting of approximately 11 acres
of land a property owned and controlled by an affiliate of our chairman and chief executive officer, was deeded to our Advisor,
which immediately deeded it to us. Our preliminary estimate of the value of Route 9W is $2.5 million based on a 2008 appraisal,
but this estimate is preliminary and subject to change. The ultimate value ascribed to Route 9W will be based on a new third-party
appraisal, which we expect will be completed by June 30, 2015. If the third-party appraisal is less than $2.5 million, we will
adjust the value at that time and our Advisor has agreed to pay us an amount in cash equal to the difference. If the third-party
appraisal is greater than our current estimate, we will not owe our Advisor any additional amounts.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt"><B>Third-Party Note</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">On May 19, 2015,
a note (the &ldquo;Third-Party Note&rdquo;) in our favor in the amount of approximately $2.7 million was executed by CM Realty
Holdings, LLC, an entity wholly owned and controlled by Craig Marshak, a non-affiliated third party. The Third-Party Note is guaranteed
by our Advisor and was substituted for the outstanding balance of the Advisor Demand Note (defined under &ldquo;&mdash;Advances
to Advisor and its Affiliates&rdquo;) upon its surrendered for cancellation in connection with the execution of the Third-Party
Note. Similarly to the Advisor Demand Note, the Third-Party Note is due on demand and bears interest at a rate of 1.5% per annum.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt"><B>Advances to Advisor and its Affiliates</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">During the period
from January 1, 2014 to May 19, 2015, we advanced funds to the Advisor and its affiliates upon the receipt of invoices for their
operating and acquisition expenses and recorded the amounts advanced as due from affiliates on our balance sheets.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Our
Advisor did not repay any of these advances during the period they were outstanding. These advances were documented through
a promissory note (the &ldquo;Advisor Demand Note&rdquo;) that was executed by the Advisor in favor of us periodically,
most recently on March 31, 2015. The Advisor Demand Note was due on demand and bore interest at a rate of 1.5% per annum,
which totaled $19,788 for the period from March 31, 2014 to May 19, 2015. There were no other material terms associated
with our Advisor&rsquo;s obligation to repay these advances to us.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">As of May 19, 2015,
our Advisor owed us approximately $5.6 million, including accrued interest, in repayment of advances we had made to the Advisor
to pay operating expenses and acquisition expenses pursuant to the Advisor Demand Note.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0.5in">Subsequently, our
Advisor took steps to satisfy its obligation to repay these advances to us by: (i) crediting of the Initial Deposit towards our
purchase of 5 Units in Lippincott DST (see &ldquo;&mdash;Lippincott DST Acquisition&rdquo;); (ii) assigning us all right, title
and interest to Route 9W (see &ldquo;&mdash;Route 9W Acquisition&rdquo;); and (iii) making a $200,000 cash payment to us. The Advisor
also arranged for the execution of the Third-Party Note in substitution for the remaining balance due under the Advisor Demand
Note after the reductions described in the preceding sentence. The Advisor Demand Note was surrendered for cancellation in connection
with the execution of the Third-Party Note. See &ldquo;&mdash;Third-Party Note.&rdquo;</P>
